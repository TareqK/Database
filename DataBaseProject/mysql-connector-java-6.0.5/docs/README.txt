Chapter 1 Overview of MySQL Connector/J

   MySQL provides connectivity for client applications developed
   in the Java programming language with MySQL Connector/J.
   Connector/J implements the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
   API
   (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/index.htm
   l), as well as a number of value-adding extensions of it. It
   also supports the new X DevAPI.

   MySQL Connector/J is a JDBC Type 4 driver. Different versions
   are available that are compatible with the JDBC 3.0
   (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jdbc/) and
   JDBC 4.2
   (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/)
   specifications (see Chapter 2, "Connector/J Versions, and the
   MySQL and Java Versions They Support"). The Type 4
   designation means that the driver is a pure Java
   implementation of the MySQL protocol and does not rely on the
   MySQL client libraries.

   For large-scale programs that use common design patterns of
   data access, consider using one of the popular persistence
   frameworks such as Hibernate (http://www.hibernate.org/),
   Spring's JDBC templates (http://www.springframework.org/) or
   Ibatis SQL Maps (http://ibatis.apache.org/) to reduce the
   amount of JDBC code for you to debug, tune, secure, and
   maintain.

Chapter 2 Connector/J Versions, and the MySQL and Java Versions
They Support

   There are currently two MySQL Connector/J versions available:

     * Connector/J 6.0 is a Type 4 pure Java JDBC 4.2 driver for
       the Java 8 platform. It provides compatibility with all
       the functionality of MySQL 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7. Connector/J
       6.0 provides ease of development features, including
       auto-registration with the Driver Manager, standardized
       validity checks, categorized SQLExceptions, support for
       large update counts, support for local and offset
       date-time variants from the java.time package, support
       for JDBC-4.x XML processing, support for per connection
       client information, and support for the NCHAR
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/char.html),
       NVARCHAR
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/char.html) and
       NCLOB data types.

     * Connector/J 5.1 is also a Type 4 pure Java JDBC driver
       that conforms to the JDBC 3.0, 4.0, ,4.1, and 4.2
       specifications. It provides compatibility with all the
       functionality of MySQL 5.1, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7.
       Connector/J 5.1 is covered by its own manual
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/5.1/en/).

   The following table summarizes the Connector/J versions
   available, along with the details of JDBC driver type,
   versions of the JDBC API supported, versions of MySQL Server
   supported, JRE supported, JDK required for building, and the
   support status for each of the Connector/J versions:

   Table 2.1 Summary of Connector/J Versions
   Connector/J version JDBC version MySQL Server version JRE
   Supported JDK Required for Compilation Status
   6.0 4.2 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 1.8.x 1.8.x Developer Milestone
   5.1 3.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 5.5, 5.6*, 5.7* 1.5.x,
   1.6.x, 1.7.x, 1.8.x* 1.5.x and 1.8.x Recommended version


   * JRE 1.8.x is required for Connector/J 5.1 to connect to
   MySQL 5.6 and 5.7 with SSL/TLS when using some cipher suites.

Chapter 3 What's New in Connector/J 6.0?

   Here is a summary of major new features of Connector/J 6.0
   (for details on the differences between the Connector/J 5.1
   and 6.0 and for instructions on migrating, see Section 4.3.1,
   "Upgrading to MySQL Connector/J 6.0"):


     * It supports MySQL 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7. See Known Issues and
       Limitations
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/5.1/en/connector-j-
       usagenotes-known-issues-limitations.html) for issues
       about support for MySQL 5.5 and 5.6.

     * It supports the JDBC 4.2 specification.

     * It is a MySQL driver for the Java 8 platform. For Java 7
       or earlier, use Connector/J 5.1 instead.

     * It supports the new X DevAPI, through which native
       support by MySQL 5.7 for JSON, NoSQL, document
       collection, and other features are provided to Java
       applications. See Using MySQL as a Document Store
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/document-store.ht
       ml), the X DevAPI User Guide
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/), and
       MySQL Connector/J X DevAPI Reference
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/connector-j) for details .

Chapter 4 Connector/J Installation

   MySQL Connector/J is distributed as a .zip or .tar.gz
   archive, available for download from the Connector/J Download
   page (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/). The
   archive contains the sources and the JAR archive named
   mysql-connector-java-version-bin.jar.

   You can install the Connector/J package using either the
   binary or source distribution. The binary distribution
   provides the easiest method for installation; the source
   distribution lets you customize your installation further.
   With either solution, you manually add the Connector/J
   location to your Java CLASSPATH.

   If you are upgrading from a previous version, read the
   upgrade information in Section 4.3, "Upgrading from an Older
   Version" before continuing.

   Connector/J is also available as part of the Maven project.
   For more information and to download the Connector/J JAR
   files, see the Maven repository
   (http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22mysql%22%20AND%2
   0a%3A%22mysql-connector-java%22).

4.1 Installing Connector/J from a Binary Distribution

   For the easiest method of installation, use the binary
   distribution of the Connector/J package. Extract the JAR
   archive from the tar/gzip or zip archive to a suitable
   location, then optionally make the information about the JAR
   archive available by changing your CLASSPATH (see Section
   4.2, "Installing the Driver and Configuring the CLASSPATH").

   Use the appropriate graphical or command-line utility to
   extract the distribution (for example, WinZip for the .zip
   archive, and tar for the .tar.gz archive). Because there are
   potentially long file names in the distribution, we use the
   GNU tar archive format. Use GNU tar (or an application that
   understands the GNU tar archive format) to unpack the .tar.gz
   variant of the distribution.

4.2 Installing the Driver and Configuring the CLASSPATH

   Once you have extracted the distribution archive, you can
   install the driver by placing
   mysql-connector-java-version-bin.jar in your classpath,
   either by adding the full path to it to your CLASSPATH
   environment variable, or by directly specifying it with the
   command line switch -cp when starting the JVM.

   To use the driver with the JDBC DriverManager, use
   com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver as the class that implements
   java.sql.Driver.

   You can set the CLASSPATH environment variable under Unix,
   Linux, or OS X either locally for a user within the user's
   .profile, .login or other login file, or you can also set it
   globally by editing the global /etc/profile file.

   For example, add the Connector/J driver to your CLASSPATH
   using one of the following forms, depending on your command
   shell:
# Bourne-compatible shell (sh, ksh, bash, zsh):
shell> export CLASSPATH=/path/mysql-connector-java-ver-bin.jar:$CLASSP
ATH

# C shell (csh, tcsh):
shell> setenv CLASSPATH /path/mysql-connector-java-ver-bin.jar:$CLASSP
ATH

   For Windows platforms, you set the environment variable
   through the System Control Panel.

   To use MySQL Connector/J with an application server such as
   GlassFish, Tomcat, or JBoss, read your vendor's documentation
   for more information on how to configure third-party class
   libraries, as most application servers ignore the CLASSPATH
   environment variable. For configuration examples for some
   J2EE application servers, see Chapter 8, "Connection Pooling
   with Connector/J," Section 9.2, "Configuring Load Balancing
   with Connector/J," and Section 9.4, "Advanced Load-balancing
   and Failover Configuration." However, the authoritative
   source for JDBC connection pool configuration information for
   your particular application server is the documentation for
   that application server.

   If you are developing servlets or JSPs, and your application
   server is J2EE-compliant, you can put the driver's .jar file
   in the WEB-INF/lib subdirectory of your webapp, as this is a
   standard location for third party class libraries in J2EE web
   applications.

   You can also use the MysqlDataSource or
   MysqlConnectionPoolDataSource classes in the
   com.mysql.cj.jdbc.jdbc2.optional package, if your J2EE
   application server supports or requires them. The
   javax.sql.XADataSource interface is implemented using the
   com.mysql.cj.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource class,
   which supports XA distributed transactions.

   The various MysqlDataSource classes support the following
   parameters (through standard set mutators):

     * user

     * password

     * serverName (see the previous section about failover
       hosts)

     * databaseName

     * port

4.3 Upgrading from an Older Version

   This section has information for users who are upgrading from
   one version of Connector/J to another, or to a new version of
   the MySQL server that supports a more recent level of JDBC. A
   newer version of Connector/J might include changes to support
   new features, improve existing functionality, or comply with
   new standards.

4.3.1 Upgrading to MySQL Connector/J 6.0

   Upgrading an application developed for Connector/J 5.1 to use
   Connector/J 6.0 might require certain changes to your code or
   the environment in which it runs. Here are some changes for
   Connector/J going from 5.1 to 6.0, for which adjustments
   might be required:

4.3.1.1 Running on the Java 8 Platform

   Connector/J 6.0 is created specifically to run on the Java 8
   platform. While Java 8 is known to be strongly compatible
   with earlier Java versions, incompatibilities do exist, and
   code designed to work on Java 7 might need to be adjusted
   before being run on Java 8. Developers should refer to the
   incompatibility information
   (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-compatibilit
   y-guide-2156366.html#A999198) provided by Oracle.

4.3.1.2 Changes in Connection Properties

   A complete list of Connector/J 6.0 connection properties are
   available in Section 6.1, "." The following are connection
   properties that have been changed (removed, added, have their
   names changed, or have their default values changed) going
   from Connector/5.1 to 6.0.

   Properties that have been removed (do not use them during
   connection):

     * useDynamicCharsetInfo

     * useBlobToStoreUTF8OutsideBMP ,
       utf8OutsideBmpExcludedColumnNamePattern, and
       utf8OutsideBmpIncludedColumnNamePattern: MySQL 5.5 and
       later supports the utf8mb4 character set, which is the
       character set that should be used by Connector/J
       applications for supporting characters beyond the Basic
       Multilingual Plane (BMP) of Unicode Version 3.

     * useJvmCharsetConverters: JVM character set conversion is
       now used in all cases

     * The following date and time properties:

          + dynamicCalendars

          + noTzConversionForTimeType

          + noTzConversionForDateType

          + cacheDefaultTimezone

          + useFastIntParsing

          + useFastDateParsing

          + useJDBCCompliantTimezoneShift

          + useLegacyDatetimeCode

          + useSSPSCompatibleTimezoneShift

          + useTimezone

          + useGmtMillisForDatetimes

     * dumpMetadataOnColumnNotFound

     * relaxAutoCommit

     * strictFloatingPoint

     * runningCTS13

     * retainStatementAfterResultSetClose

   Properties that have been added:

     * mysqlx.useAsyncProtocol

   Property that has its name changed:

     * com.mysql.jdbc.faultInjection.serverCharsetIndex changed
       to
       com.mysql.cj.testsuite.faultInjection.serverCharsetIndex

     * loadBalanceEnableJMX to ha.enableJMX

     * replicationEnableJMX to ha.enableJMX

   Properties that have their default values changed:

     * nullCatalogMeansCurrent is now false by default

     * nullNamePatternMatchesAll is now false by default

4.3.1.3 Changes in the Connector/J API

   This section describes the changes to the Connector/J API
   going from version 5.1 to 6.0. You might need to adjust your
   API calls accordingly:

     * The name of the class that implements java.sql.Driver in
       MySQL Connector/J has changed from com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
       to com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver. The old class name has been
       deprecated.

     * The names of these commonly-used interfaces have also
       been changed:

          + ExceptionInterceptor: from
            com.mysql.jdbc.ExceptionInterceptor to
            com.mysql.cj.api.exceptions.ExceptionInterceptor

          + StatementInterceptor: from
            com.mysql.jdbc.StatementInterceptorV2 to
            com.mysql.cj.api.jdbc.interceptors.StatementIntercep
            torV2

          + ConnectionLifecycleInterceptor: from
            com.mysql.jdbc.ConnectionLifecycleInterceptor to
            com.mysql.cj.api.jdbc.interceptors.ConnectionLifecyc
            leInterceptor

          + AuthenticationPlugin: from
            com.mysql.jdbc.AuthenticationPlugin to
            com.mysql.cj.api.authentication.AuthenticationPlugin

          + BalanceStrategy: from com.mysql.jdbc.BalanceStrategy
            to com.mysql.cj.api.jdbc.ha.BalanceStrategy.

4.3.1.4 Changes for Build Properties

   A number of Ant properties for building Connector/J from
   source have been renamed; see Section 4.3.1.4, ""

4.3.1.6 Other Changes

   Here are other changes with Connector/J 6.0:

     * Removed ReplicationDriver. Instead of using a separate
       driver, you can now obtain a connection for a replication
       setup just by using the jdbc:mysql:replication:// scheme.

     * Requires the following third-party libraries to work:

          + Protocol Buffers

          + Javassist (only required for building Connector/J
            6.0 from source)

4.4 Installing from the Development Source Tree

   Caution

   Read this section only if you are interested in helping us
   test our new code. To just get MySQL Connector/J up and
   running on your system, use a standard binary release
   distribution.

   To install MySQL Connector/J from the development source
   tree, make sure that you have the following software on your
   system:

     * A Git client, to check out the sources from our GitHub
       repository (available from http://git-scm.com/downloads).

     * Apache Ant version 1.8.2 or newer (available from
       http://ant.apache.org/).

     * JDK 1.8.x.

     * JUnit 4.1.2 (available from
       https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Download-and-Ins
       tall).

     * Javaassist 3.19 or newer (available from
       http://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/).

     * Protocol Buffers Java API 2.6.0 or newer (available from,
       for example, the Maven Central Repository
       (http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.g
       oogle.protobuf%22%20AND%20a%3A%22protobuf-java%22)).

     * The required .jar files from the Hibernate ORM 4.1 or 4.2
       Final release bundle (available at
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate
       4/).

   To check out and compile MySQL Connector/J, follow these
   steps:

    1. Check out the code from the source code repository for
       MySQL Connector/J located on GitHub at
       https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j. The latest
       release of the Connector/J 6.0 series is on the
       release/6.0 branch; use the following command to check it
       out:
shell> git clone --branch release/6.0 https://github.com/mysql/mysql-c
onnector-j.git

       Under the current directory, the commands create a
       mysql-connector-j subdirectory , which contains the code
       you want.

    2. Make sure that you have JDK 1.8.x installed.

    3. Place the required junit.jar, javaassist.jar, and
       protobuf-java-x.y.z.jar files in a separate
       directory---for example, /home/username/ant-extralibs.

    4. In the same directory for extra libraries described in
       the last step, create a directory named hibernate4, and
       put under it all the .jar files you can find under the
       /lib/required/ folder in the Hibernate ORM 4 Final
       release bundle.

    5. Change your current working directory to the
       mysql-connector-j directory created in step 1 above.

    6. In the directory, create a file named build.properties to
       indicate to Ant the locations of the root directories for
       your JDK 1.8.x installation, as well as the location of
       the extra libraries. The file should contain the
       following property settings, with the "path_to_*" parts
       replaced by the appropriate filepaths:
com.mysql.cj.build.jdk=path_to_jdk_1.8
com.mysql.cj.extra.libs=path_to_folder_for_extra_libraries

       Alternatively, you can set the values of those properties
       through the Ant -D options.

    7. Issue the following command to compile the driver and
       create a .jar file for Connector/J:
shell> ant dist

       This creates a build directory in the current directory,
       where all the build output goes. A directory is created
       under the build directory, whose name includes the
       version number of the release you are building. That
       directory contains the sources, the compiled .class
       files, and a .jar file for deployment. For more
       information and other possible targets, including those
       that create a fully packaged distribution, issue the
       following command:
shell> ant -projecthelp


    8. Install the newly created .jar file for the JDBC driver
       as you would install a binary .jar file you download from
       MySQL by following the instructions given in Section 4.2,
       "Installing the Driver and Configuring the CLASSPATH."

   Note that a package containing both the binary and source
   code for Connector/J 6.0 can also be downloaded from the
   Connector/J Download page
   (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).
   Note

   Going from Connector/J 5.1 to 6.0, a number of Ant properties
   for building Connecotr/J have been renamed or removed; see
   Section 4.3.1.4, "Changes for Build Properties" for details.

4.5 Testing Connector/J

   The Connector/J source code repository or packages that are
   shipped with source code include an extensive test suite,
   containing test cases that can be executed independently. The
   test cases are divided into the following categories:

     * Unit tests: They are methods located in packages aligning
       with the classes that they test.

     * Functional tests: Classes from the package
       testsuite.simple. Include test code for the main features
       of the Connector/J.

     * Performance tests: Classes from the package
       testsuite.perf. Include test code to make measurements
       for the performance of Connector/J.

     * Regression tests: Classes from the package
       testsuite.regression. Includes code for testing bug and
       regression fixes.

     * MySQL X tests: Classes from the package testsuite.mysqlx
       and testsuite.x for testing MySQL X functionality.

   The bundled Ant build file contains targets like test, which
   can facilitate the process of running the Connector/J tests;
   see the target descriptions in the build file for details.
   Besides the requirements for building Connector/J from the
   source code described in Section 4.4, "Installing from the
   Development Source Tree," a number of the tests also require
   the File System Service Provider 1.2 for the Java Naming and
   Directory Interface (JNDI), available at
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloa
   ds/java-archive-downloads-java-plat-419418.html)---place the
   jar files downloaded from there into the lib directory or in
   the directory pointed to by the property
   com.mysql.cj.extra.libs.

   To run the test using Ant, in addition to the properties
   required for Section 4.4, "Installing from the Development
   Source Tree," you must set the following properties in the
   build.properties file or through the Ant -D options:

     * com.mysql.cj.testsuite.url: it specifies the JDBC URL for
       connection to a MySQL test server; see Section 6.1,
       "Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL Syntax and
       Configuration Properties for Connector/J."

     * com.mysql.cj.testsuite.jvm: the JVM to be used for the
       tests. If the property is not set, the JVM supplied with
       com.mysql.cj.build.jdk will be used.

   After setting these parameters, run the tests with Ant in the
   following ways:

     * Building the test target with ant test runs all test
       cases by default on a single server instance. If you want
       to run a particular test case, put the test's fully
       qualified class names in the test variable; for example:
shell > ant -Dtest=testsuite.simple.StringUtilsTest test
       You can also run individual tests in a test case by
       specifying the names of the corresponding methods in the
       methods variable, separating multiple methods by commas;
       for example:
shell > ant -Dtest=testsuite.simple.StringUtilsTest -Dmethods=testInde
xOfIgnoreCase,testGetBytes test

   While the test results are partially reported by the console,
   complete reports in HTML and XML formats are provided. View
   the HTML report by opening
   build/junit/unitregress/report/index.html. XML version of the
   reports are located in the folder build/junit/unitregress.
   Note

   Going from Connector/J 5.1 to 6.0, a number of Ant properties
   for testing Connecotr/J have been renamed or removed; see
   Section 4.3.1.5, "Change for Test Properties" for details.

Chapter 6 Connector/J (JDBC) Reference

   This section of the manual contains reference material for
   MySQL Connector/J.

6.1 Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL Syntax and Configuration
Properties for Connector/J

   The name of the class that implements java.sql.Driver in
   MySQL Connector/J is com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver.

JDBC URL Format

   The general format for a JDBC URL for connecting to a MySQL
   server is as follows, with items in square brackets ([ ])
   being optional:
jdbc:mysql://[host1][:port1][,[host2][:port2]]...[/[database]] ??
[?propertyName1=propertyValue1[&propertyName2=propertyValue2]...]

   Here is a simple example for a connection URL:
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sakila?profileSQL=true

   Supply multiple hosts for a server failover setup (see
   Chapter 9, "Multi-Host Connections" for details):
# Connection URL for a server failover setup:
jdbc:mysql//primaryhost,secondaryhost1,secondaryhost2/test

   There are specialized URL schemes for configuring
   Connector/J's multi-host functions like load balancing and
   replication; here are some examples (see Chapter 9,
   "Multi-Host Connections" for details):
# Connection URL for load balancing:
jdbc:mysql:loadbalance://localhost:3306,localhost:3310/sakila

# Connection URL for server replication:
jdbc:mysql:replication://master,slave1,slave2,slave3/test

Host and Port

   If no hosts are not specified, the host name defaults to
   127.0.0.1. If the port for a host is not specified, it
   defaults to 3306, the default port number for MySQL servers.

Initial Database for Connection

   If the database is not specified, the connection is made with
   no default database. In this case, either call the
   setCatalog() method on the Connection instance, or fully
   specify table names using the database name (that is, SELECT
   dbname.tablename.colname FROM dbname.tablename...) in your
   SQL. Opening a connection without specifying the database to
   use is generally only useful when building tools that work
   with multiple databases, such as GUI database managers.
   Note

   Always use the Connection.setCatalog() method to specify the
   desired database in JDBC applications, rather than the USE
   database statement.

Alternate Format for JDBC URLs

   The following is an alternate format for JDBC URLs connecting
   to a MySQL server, which is mandatory for IPv6 connections,
   but can also be used with IPv4 (items in square brackets ([
   ]) are optional):
jdbc:mysql://address=(key1=value)[(key2=value)]...[,address=(key3=valu
e)[(key4=value)]...]...[/[database]]??
[?propertyName1=propertyValue1[&propertyName2=propertyValue2]...]

   Supported key-value pairs include:

     * (protocol=tcp), or (protocol=pipe) for named pipes on
       Windows.

     * (path=path_to_pipe) for path of named pipes. Default
       value for the path is \\.\pipe\MySQL. Use the key-value
       pair to specify a custom named pipe.

     * (host=hostname) for TCP connections.

     * (port=port_number) for TCP connections.

   For example:
jdbc:mysql://address=(protocol=tcp)(host=localhost)(port=3306)/db

   Notice that the alternate format greatly simplifies the URL
   for a named pipe connection on Windows. For example, to use
   the default named pipe of "\\.\pipe\MySQL," just specifies:
jdbc:mysql://address=(protocol=pipe)/test

   To use the custom named pipe of "\\.\pipe\MySQL57" :
jdbc:mysql://address=(protocol=pipe)(path=\\.\pipe\MySQL57)/test

   Keys other than protocol, path, host, and port are treated as
   host-specific configuration properties, which allow per-host
   overrides of configuration properties set for multi-host
   connections (that is, when using failover, load balancing, or
   replication). For example:
# Connection URL in the alternate format for a server failover setup:
jdbc:mysql://address=(protocol=tcp)(host=primaryhost)(port=3306),??
address=(protocol=tcp)(host=secondaryhost1)(port=3310)(user=test2)/tes
t

# Connection URL in the alternate format for a load balancing setup:
jdbc:mysql:loadbalance://address=(protocol=tcp)(host=localhost)(port=3
306)(user=test1),??
address=(protocol=tcp)(host=localhost)(port=3310)(user=test2)/sakila

# Connection URL in the alternate format for a server replication setu
p:
jdbc:mysql:replication://address=(protocol=tcp)(host=master)(port=3306
)(user=test1),??
address=(protocol=tcp)(host=slave1)(port=3310)(user=test2)/test

   Limit the overrides to user, password, network timeouts, and
   statement and metadata cache sizes; the effects of other
   per-host overrides are not defined.

   The ways to set other configuration properties for the
   connection are the same for the general and the alternate URL
   formats; see Section 6.1, "."

Setting Configuration Properties

   Configuration properties define how Connector/J will make a
   connection to a MySQL server. Unless otherwise noted,
   properties can be set for a DataSource object or for a
   Connection object.

   Configuration properties can be set in one of the following
   ways:

     * Using the set*() methods on MySQL implementations of
       java.sql.DataSource (which is the preferred method when
       using implementations of java.sql.DataSource):

          + com.mysql.cj.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource

          + com.mysql.cj.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlConnectionPool
            DataSource

     * As a key/value pair in the java.util.Properties instance
       passed to DriverManager.getConnection() or
       Driver.connect()

     * As a JDBC URL parameter in the URL given to
       java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(),
       java.sql.Driver.connect() or the MySQL implementations of
       the javax.sql.DataSource setURL() method. If you specify
       a configuration property in the URL without providing a
       value for it, nothing will be set; for example, adding
       useServerPrepStmts alone to the URL does not make
       Connector/J use server-side prepared statements; you need
       to add useServerPrepStmts=true.
       Note
       If the mechanism you use to configure a JDBC URL is
       XML-based, use the XML character literal &amp; to
       separate configuration parameters, as the ampersand is a
       reserved character for XML.

   The properties are listed in the following tables.

   Authentication.
   Properties and Descriptions

   user

   The user to connect as

   Since version: all versions

   password

   The password to use when connecting

   Since version: all versions

   Connection.
   Properties and Descriptions

   connectionAttributes

   A comma-delimited list of user-defined key:value pairs (in
   addition to standard MySQL-defined key:value pairs) to be
   passed to MySQL Server for display as connection attributes
   in the PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.SESSION_CONNECT_ATTRS table.
   Example usage: connectionAttributes=key1:value1,key2:value2
   This functionality is available for use with MySQL Server
   version 5.6 or later only. Earlier versions of MySQL Server
   do not support connection attributes, causing this
   configuration option to be ignored. Setting
   connectionAttributes=none will cause connection attribute
   processing to be bypassed, for situations where Connection
   creation/initialization speed is critical.

   Since version: 5.1.25

   connectionLifecycleInterceptors

   A comma-delimited list of classes that implement
   "com.mysql.cj.api.jdbc.interceptors.ConnectionLifecycleInterc
   eptor" that should notified of connection lifecycle events
   (creation, destruction, commit, rollback, setCatalog and
   setAutoCommit) and potentially alter the execution of these
   commands. ConnectionLifecycleInterceptors are "stackable",
   more than one interceptor may be specified via the
   configuration property as a comma-delimited list, with the
   interceptors executed in order from left to right.

   Since version: 5.1.4

   useConfigs

   Load the comma-delimited list of configuration properties
   before parsing the URL or applying user-specified properties.
   These configurations are explained in the 'Configurations' of
   the documentation.

   Since version: 3.1.5

   authenticationPlugins

   Comma-delimited list of classes that implement
   com.mysql.cj.api.mysqla.authentication.AuthenticationPlugin
   and which will be used for authentication unless disabled by
   "disabledAuthenticationPlugins" property.

   Since version: 5.1.19

   createDatabaseIfNotExist

   Creates the database given in the URL if it doesn't yet
   exist. Assumes the configured user has permissions to create
   databases.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.9

   defaultAuthenticationPlugin

   Name of a class implementing
   com.mysql.cj.api.mysqla.authentication.AuthenticationPlugin
   which will be used as the default authentication plugin (see
   below). It is an error to use a class which is not listed in
   "authenticationPlugins" nor it is one of the built-in
   plugins. It is an error to set as default a plugin which was
   disabled with "disabledAuthenticationPlugins" property. It is
   an error to set this value to null or the empty string (i.e.
   there must be at least a valid default authentication plugin
   specified for the connection, meeting all constraints listed
   above).

   Default:
   com.mysql.cj.mysqla.authentication.MysqlNativePasswordPlugin

   Since version: 5.1.19

   detectCustomCollations

   Should the driver detect custom charsets/collations installed
   on server (true/false, defaults to 'false'). If this option
   set to 'true' driver gets actual charsets/collations from
   server each time connection establishes. This could slow down
   connection initialization significantly.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.29

   disabledAuthenticationPlugins

   Comma-delimited list of classes implementing
   com.mysql.cj.api.mysqla.authentication.AuthenticationPlugin
   or mechanisms, i.e. "mysql_native_password". The
   authentication plugins or mechanisms listed will not be used
   for authentication which will fail if it requires one of
   them. It is an error to disable the default authentication
   plugin (either the one named by "defaultAuthenticationPlugin"
   property or the hard-coded one if
   "defaultAuthenticationPlugin" property is not set).

   Since version: 5.1.19

   disconnectOnExpiredPasswords

   If "disconnectOnExpiredPasswords" is set to "false" and
   password is expired then server enters "sandbox" mode and
   sends ERR(08001, ER_MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD) for all commands
   that are not needed to set a new password until a new
   password is set.

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.1.23

   interactiveClient

   Set the CLIENT_INTERACTIVE flag, which tells MySQL to timeout
   connections based on INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT instead of
   WAIT_TIMEOUT

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.0

   passwordCharacterEncoding

   What character encoding is used for passwords? Leaving this
   set to the default value (null), uses the value set in
   "characterEncoding" if there is one, otherwise uses UTF-8 as
   default encoding. If the password contains non-ASCII
   characters, the password encoding must match what server
   encoding was set to when the password was created. For
   passwords in other character encodings, the encoding will
   have to be specified with this property (or with
   "characterEncoding"), as it's not possible for the driver to
   auto-detect this.

   Since version: 5.1.7

   propertiesTransform

   An implementation of
   com.mysql.cj.api.conf.ConnectionPropertiesTransform that the
   driver will use to modify URL properties passed to the driver
   before attempting a connection

   Since version: 3.1.4

   rollbackOnPooledClose

   Should the driver issue a rollback() when the logical
   connection in a pool is closed?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.15

   useAffectedRows

   Don't set the CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS flag when connecting to the
   server (not JDBC-compliant, will break most applications that
   rely on "found" rows vs. "affected rows" for DML statements),
   but does cause "correct" update counts from "INSERT ... ON
   DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE" statements to be returned by the
   server.

   maxAllowedPacket

   Maximum allowed packet size to send to server. If not set,
   the value of system variable 'max_allowed_packet' will be
   used to initialize this upon connecting. This value will not
   take effect if set larger than the value of
   'max_allowed_packet'. Also, due to an internal dependency
   with the property "blobSendChunkSize", this setting has a
   minimum value of "8203" if "useServerPrepStmts" is set to
   "true".

   Default: 65535

   Since version: 5.1.8

   Require server support of SSL connection if useSSL=true?
   (defaults to 'false').

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.0

   verifyServerCertificate

   If "useSSL" is set to "true", should the driver verify the
   server's certificate? When using this feature, the keystore
   parameters should be specified by the
   "clientCertificateKeyStore*" properties, rather than system
   properties. Default is 'false' when connecting to MySQL
   5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ or 5.7.6+ and "useSSL" was not explicitly
   set to "true". Otherwise default is 'true'

   use the default, which is "JKS". Standard keystore types
   supported by the JVM are "JKS" and "PKCS12", your environment
   may have more available depending on what security products
   are installed and available to the JVM.

   Default: JKS

   Since version: 5.1.0

   key will be retrieved from the server.

   Since version: 5.1.31

   Statements.
   Properties and Descriptions

   continueBatchOnError

   Should the driver continue processing batch commands if one
   statement fails. The JDBC spec allows either way (defaults to
   'true').

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.3

   dontTrackOpenResources

   The JDBC specification requires the driver to automatically
   track and close resources, however if your application
   doesn't do a good job of explicitly calling close() on
   statements or result sets, this can cause memory leakage.
   Setting this property to true relaxes this constraint, and
   can be more memory efficient for some applications. Also the
   automatic closing of the Statement and current ResultSet in
   Statement.closeOnCompletion() and Statement.getMoreResults
   ([Statement.CLOSE_CURRENT_RESULT |
   Statement.CLOSE_ALL_RESULTS]), respectively, ceases to
   happen. This property automatically sets
   holdResultsOpenOverStatementClose=true.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.7

   queryTimeoutKillsConnection

   If the timeout given in Statement.setQueryTimeout() expires,
   should the driver forcibly abort the Connection instead of
   attempting to abort the query?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.9

   statementInterceptors

   A comma-delimited list of classes that implement
   "com.mysql.cj.api.jdbc.interceptors.StatementInterceptor"
   that should be placed "in between" query execution to
   influence the results. StatementInterceptors are "chainable",
   the results returned by the "current" interceptor will be
   passed on to the next in in the chain, from left-to-right
   order, as specified in this property.

   Since version: 5.1.1

   Prepared Statements.
   Properties and Descriptions

   allowNanAndInf

   Should the driver allow NaN or +/- INF values in
   PreparedStatement.setDouble()?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.5

   autoClosePStmtStreams

   Should the driver automatically call .close() on
   streams/readers passed as arguments via set*() methods?

   Default: false

   compensateOnDuplicateKeyUpdateCounts

   Should the driver compensate for the update counts of "ON
   DUPLICATE KEY" INSERT statements (2 = 1, 0 = 1) when using
   prepared statements?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.7

   emulateUnsupportedPstmts

   Should the driver detect prepared statements that are not
   supported by the server, and replace them with client-side
   emulated versions?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.7

   generateSimpleParameterMetadata

   Should the driver generate simplified parameter metadata for
   PreparedStatements when no metadata is available either
   because the server couldn't support preparing the statement,
   or server-side prepared statements are disabled?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.5

   processEscapeCodesForPrepStmts

   Should the driver process escape codes in queries that are
   prepared? Default escape processing behavior in non-prepared
   statements must be defined with the property
   'enableEscapeProcessing'.

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.12

   useServerPrepStmts

   Use server-side prepared statements if the server supports
   them?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.0

   useStreamLengthsInPrepStmts

   Honor stream length parameter in
   PreparedStatement/ResultSet.setXXXStream() method calls
   (true/false, defaults to 'true')?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.2

   Result Sets.
   Properties and Descriptions

   clobberStreamingResults

   This will cause a 'streaming' ResultSet to be automatically
   closed, and any outstanding data still streaming from the
   server to be discarded if another query is executed before
   all the data has been read from the server.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.9

   emptyStringsConvertToZero

   Should the driver allow conversions from empty string fields
   to numeric values of '0'?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.8

   holdResultsOpenOverStatementClose

   Should the driver close result sets on Statement.close() as
   required by the JDBC specification?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.7

   jdbcCompliantTruncation

   Should the driver throw java.sql.DataTruncation exceptions
   when data is truncated as is required by the JDBC
   specification when connected to a server that supports
   warnings (MySQL 4.1.0 and newer)? This property has no effect
   if the server sql-mode includes STRICT_TRANS_TABLES.

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.2

   maxRows

   The maximum number of rows to return (0, the default means
   return all rows).

   Default: -1

   Since version: all versions

   netTimeoutForStreamingResults

   What value should the driver automatically set the server
   setting 'net_write_timeout' to when the streaming result sets
   feature is in use? (value has unit of seconds, the value '0'
   means the driver will not try and adjust this value)

   Default: 600

   Since version: 5.1.0

   padCharsWithSpace

   If a result set column has the CHAR type and the value does
   not fill the amount of characters specified in the DDL for
   the column, should the driver pad the remaining characters
   with space (for ANSI compliance)?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.6

   populateInsertRowWithDefaultValues

   When using ResultSets that are CONCUR_UPDATABLE, should the
   driver pre-populate the "insert" row with default values from
   the DDL for the table used in the query so those values are
   immediately available for ResultSet accessors? This
   functionality requires a call to the database for metadata
   each time a result set of this type is created. If disabled
   (the default), the default values will be populated by the an
   internal call to refreshRow() which pulls back default values
   and/or values changed by triggers.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.5

   strictUpdates

   Should the driver do strict checking (all primary keys
   selected) of updatable result sets (true, false, defaults to
   'true')?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.4

   tinyInt1isBit

   Should the driver treat the datatype TINYINT(1) as the BIT
   type (because the server silently converts BIT -> TINYINT(1)
   when creating tables)?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.16

   transformedBitIsBoolean

   If the driver converts TINYINT(1) to a different type, should
   it use BOOLEAN instead of BIT for future compatibility with
   MySQL-5.0, as MySQL-5.0 has a BIT type?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.9

   Metadata.
   Properties and Descriptions

   getProceduresReturnsFunctions

   Pre-JDBC4 DatabaseMetaData API has only the getProcedures()
   and getProcedureColumns() methods, so they return metadata
   info for both stored procedures and functions. JDBC4 was
   extended with the getFunctions() and getFunctionColumns()
   methods and the expected behaviours of previous methods are
   not well defined. For JDBC4 and higher, default 'true' value
   of the option means that calls of
   DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures() and
   DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns() return metadata for
   both procedures and functions as before, keeping backward
   compatibility. Setting this property to 'false' decouples
   Connector/J from its pre-JDBC4 behaviours for
   DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures() and
   DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns(), forcing them to
   return metadata for procedures only.

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.1.26

   noAccessToProcedureBodies

   When determining procedure parameter types for
   CallableStatements, and the connected user can't access
   procedure bodies through "SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE" or select on
   mysql.proc should the driver instead create basic metadata
   (all parameters reported as INOUT VARCHARs) instead of
   throwing an exception?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.3

   nullCatalogMeansCurrent

   When DatabaseMetadataMethods ask for a 'catalog' parameter,
   does the value null mean use the current catalog? (this is
   not JDBC-compliant, but follows legacy behavior from earlier
   versions of the driver)

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.8

   nullNamePatternMatchesAll

   Should DatabaseMetaData methods that accept *pattern
   parameters treat null the same as '%' (this is not
   JDBC-compliant, however older versions of the driver accepted
   this departure from the specification)

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.8

   useHostsInPrivileges

   Add '@hostname' to users in
   DatabaseMetaData.getColumn/TablePrivileges() (true/false),
   defaults to 'true'.

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.2

   useInformationSchema

   When connected to MySQL-5.0.7 or newer, should the driver use
   the INFORMATION_SCHEMA to derive information used by
   DatabaseMetaData?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.0

   BLOB/CLOB processing.
   Properties and Descriptions

   autoDeserialize

   Should the driver automatically detect and de-serialize
   objects stored in BLOB fields?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.5

   blobSendChunkSize

   Chunk size to use when sending BLOB/CLOBs via
   ServerPreparedStatements. Note that this value cannot exceed
   the value of "maxAllowedPacket" and, if that is the case,
   then this value will be corrected automatically.

   Default: 1048576

   Since version: 3.1.9

   blobsAreStrings

   Should the driver always treat BLOBs as Strings -
   specifically to work around dubious metadata returned by the
   server for GROUP BY clauses?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.8

   clobCharacterEncoding

   The character encoding to use for sending and retrieving
   TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT and LONGTEXT values instead of the
   configured connection characterEncoding

   Since version: 5.0.0

   emulateLocators

   Should the driver emulate java.sql.Blobs with locators? With
   this feature enabled, the driver will delay loading the
   actual Blob data until the one of the retrieval methods
   (getInputStream(), getBytes(), and so forth) on the blob data
   stream has been accessed. For this to work, you must use a
   column alias with the value of the column to the actual name
   of the Blob. The feature also has the following restrictions:
   The SELECT that created the result set must reference only
   one table, the table must have a primary key; the SELECT must
   alias the original blob column name, specified as a string,
   to an alternate name; the SELECT must cover all columns that
   make up the primary key.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.0

   functionsNeverReturnBlobs

   Should the driver always treat data from functions returning
   BLOBs as Strings - specifically to work around dubious
   metadata returned by the server for GROUP BY clauses?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.8

   locatorFetchBufferSize

   If 'emulateLocators' is configured to 'true', what size
   buffer should be used when fetching BLOB data for
   getBinaryInputStream?

   Default: 1048576

   Since version: 3.2.1

   Datetime types processing.
   Properties and Descriptions

   noDatetimeStringSync

   Don't ensure that
   ResultSet.getDatetimeType().toString().equals(ResultSet.getSt
   ring())

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.7

   sendFractionalSeconds

   Send fractional part from TIMESTAMP seconds. If set to false,
   the nanoseconds value of TIMESTAMP values will be truncated
   before sending any data to the server. This option applies
   only to prepared statements, callable statements or updatable
   result sets.

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.1.37

   serverTimezone

   Override detection/mapping of time zone. Used when time zone
   from server doesn't map to Java time zone

   Since version: 3.0.2

   treatUtilDateAsTimestamp

   Should the driver treat java.util.Date as a TIMESTAMP for the
   purposes of PreparedStatement.setObject()?

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.0.5

   yearIsDateType

   Should the JDBC driver treat the MySQL type "YEAR" as a
   java.sql.Date, or as a SHORT?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.9

   zeroDateTimeBehavior

   What should happen when the driver encounters DATETIME values
   that are composed entirely of zeros (used by MySQL to
   represent invalid dates)? Valid values are "exception",
   "round" and "convertToNull".

   Default: exception

   Since version: 3.1.4

   High Availability and Clustering.
   Properties and Descriptions

   autoReconnect

   Should the driver try to re-establish stale and/or dead
   connections? If enabled the driver will throw an exception
   for a queries issued on a stale or dead connection, which
   belong to the current transaction, but will attempt reconnect
   before the next query issued on the connection in a new
   transaction. The use of this feature is not recommended,
   because it has side effects related to session state and data
   consistency when applications don't handle SQLExceptions
   properly, and is only designed to be used when you are unable
   to configure your application to handle SQLExceptions
   resulting from dead and stale connections properly.
   Alternatively, as a last option, investigate setting the
   MySQL server variable "wait_timeout" to a high value, rather
   than the default of 8 hours.

   Default: false

   Since version: 1.1

   autoReconnectForPools

   Use a reconnection strategy appropriate for connection pools
   (defaults to 'false')

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.3

   failOverReadOnly

   connection be set to 'read-only'?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.12

   maxReconnects

   Maximum number of reconnects to attempt if autoReconnect is
   true, default is '3'.

   Default: 3

   Since version: 1.1

   reconnectAtTxEnd

   If autoReconnect is set to true, should the driver attempt
   reconnections at the end of every transaction?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.10

   retriesAllDown

   When using loadbalancing or failover, the number of times the
   driver should cycle through available hosts, attempting to
   connect. Between cycles, the driver will pause for 250ms if
   no servers are available.

   Default: 120

   Since version: 5.1.6

   initialTimeout

   If autoReconnect is enabled, the initial time to wait between
   re-connect attempts (in seconds, defaults to '2').

   Default: 2

   Since version: 1.1

   queriesBeforeRetryMaster

   Number of queries to issue before falling back to the primary
   host when failed over (when using multi-host failover).
   Whichever condition is met first, 'queriesBeforeRetryMaster'
   or 'secondsBeforeRetryMaster' will cause an attempt to be
   made to reconnect to the primary host. Setting both
   properties to 0 disables the automatic fall back to the
   primary host at transaction boundaries. Defaults to 50.

   Default: 50

   Since version: 3.0.2

   secondsBeforeRetryMaster

   How long should the driver wait, when failed over, before
   attempting to reconnect to the primary host? Whichever
   condition is met first, 'queriesBeforeRetryMaster' or
   'secondsBeforeRetryMaster' will cause an attempt to be made
   to reconnect to the master. Setting both properties to 0
   disables the automatic fall back to the primary host at
   transaction boundaries. Time in seconds, defaults to 30

   Default: 30

   Since version: 3.0.2

   allowMasterDownConnections

   By default, a replication-aware connection will fail to
   connect when configured master hosts are all unavailable at
   initial connection. Setting this property to 'true' allows to
   establish the initial connection, by failing over to the
   slave servers, in read-only state. It won't prevent
   subsequent failures when switching back to the master hosts
   i.e. by setting the replication connection to read/write
   state.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.27

   allowSlaveDownConnections

   By default, a replication-aware connection will fail to
   connect when configured slave hosts are all unavailable at
   initial connection. Setting this property to 'true' allows to
   establish the initial connection. It won't prevent failures
   when switching to slaves i.e. by setting the replication
   connection to read-only state. The property
   'readFromMasterWhenNoSlaves' should be used for this purpose.

   Default: false

   Since version: 6.0.2

   ha.enableJMX

   Enables JMX-based management of load-balanced connection
   groups, including live addition/removal of hosts from
   load-balancing pool. Enables JMX-based management of
   replication connection groups, including live slave
   promotion, addition of new slaves and removal of master or
   slave hosts from load-balanced master and slave connection
   pools.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.27

   loadBalanceHostRemovalGracePeriod

   Sets the grace period to wait for a host being removed from a
   load-balanced connection, to be released when it is currently
   the active host.

   Default: 15000

   Since version: 6.0.3

   readFromMasterWhenNoSlaves

   Replication-aware connections distribute load by using the
   master hosts when in read/write state and by using the slave
   hosts when in read-only state. If, when setting the
   connection to read-only state, none of the slave hosts are
   available, an SQLExeception is thrown back. Setting this
   property to 'true' allows to fail over to the master hosts,
   while setting the connection state to read-only, when no
   slave hosts are available at switch instant.

   Default: false

   Since version: 6.0.2

   selfDestructOnPingMaxOperations

   =If set to a non-zero value, the driver will report close the
   connection and report failure when Connection.ping() or
   Connection.isValid(int) is called if the connection's count
   of commands sent to the server exceeds this value.

   Default: 0

   Since version: 5.1.6

   selfDestructOnPingSecondsLifetime

   If set to a non-zero value, the driver will report close the
   connection and report failure when Connection.ping() or
   Connection.isValid(int) is called if the connection's
   lifetime exceeds this value.

   Default: 0

   Since version: 5.1.6

   ha.loadBalanceStrategy

   If using a load-balanced connection to connect to SQL nodes
   in a MySQL Cluster/NDB configuration (by using the URL prefix
   "jdbc:mysql:loadbalance://"), which load balancing algorithm
   should the driver use: (1) "random" - the driver will pick a
   random host for each request. This tends to work better than
   round-robin, as the randomness will somewhat account for
   spreading loads where requests vary in response time, while
   round-robin can sometimes lead to overloaded nodes if there
   are variations in response times across the workload. (2)
   "bestResponseTime" - the driver will route the request to the
   host that had the best response time for the previous
   transaction.

   Default: random

   Since version: 5.0.6

   loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementRegex

   When load-balancing is enabled for auto-commit statements
   (via loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementThreshold), the statement
   counter will only increment when the SQL matches the regular
   expression. By default, every statement issued matches.

   Since version: 5.1.15

   loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementThreshold

   When auto-commit is enabled, the number of statements which
   should be executed before triggering load-balancing to
   rebalance. Default value of 0 causes load-balanced
   connections to only rebalance when exceptions are
   encountered, or auto-commit is disabled and transactions are
   explicitly committed or rolled back.

   Default: 0

   Since version: 5.1.15

   loadBalanceBlacklistTimeout

   Time in milliseconds between checks of servers which are
   unavailable, by controlling how long a server lives in the
   global blacklist.

   Default: 0

   Fully-qualified class name of custom exception checker. The
   class must implement
   com.mysql.cj.api.jdbc.ha.LoadBalanceExceptionChecker
   interface, and is used to inspect SQLExceptions and determine
   whether they should trigger fail-over to another host in a
   load-balanced deployment.

   Default:

   Since version: 5.1.13

   loadBalancePingTimeout

   Time in milliseconds to wait for ping response from each of
   load-balanced physical connections when using load-balanced
   Connection.

   Default: 0

   loadBalanceSQLExceptionSubclassFailover

   Comma-delimited list of classes/interfaces used by default
   load-balanced exception checker to determine whether a given
   SQLException should trigger failover. The comparison is done
   using Class.isInstance(SQLException) using the thrown
   SQLException.

   Since version: 5.1.13

   loadBalanceSQLStateFailover

   Comma-delimited list of SQLState codes used by default
   load-balanced exception checker to determine whether a given
   SQLException should trigger failover. The SQLState of a given
   SQLException is evaluated to determine whether it begins with
   any value in the comma-delimited list.

   Since version: 5.1.13

   loadBalanceValidateConnectionOnSwapServer

   Should the load-balanced Connection explicitly check whether
   the connection is live when swapping to a new physical
   connection at commit/rollback?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.13

   pinGlobalTxToPhysicalConnection

   When using XAConnections, should the driver ensure that
   operations on a given XID are always routed to the same
   physical connection? This allows the XAConnection to support
   "XA START ... JOIN" after "XA END" has been called

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.1

   resourceId

   A globally unique name that identifies the resource that this
   datasource or connection is connected to, used for

   useLocalSessionState

   Should the driver refer to the internal values of autocommit
   and transaction isolation that are set by
   Connection.setAutoCommit() and
   Connection.setTransactionIsolation() and transaction state as
   maintained by the protocol, rather than querying the database
   or blindly sending commands to the database for commit() or
   rollback() method calls?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.7

   useLocalTransactionState

   Should the driver use the in-transaction state provided by
   the MySQL protocol to determine if a commit() or rollback()
   should actually be sent to the database?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.7

   prepStmtCacheSize

   If prepared statement caching is enabled, how many prepared
   statements should be cached?

   Default: 25

   Since version: 3.0.10

   prepStmtCacheSqlLimit

   If prepared statement caching is enabled, what's the largest
   SQL the driver will cache the parsing for?

   Default: 256

   Since version: 3.0.10

   String>>, which will be used to create caches for MySQL
   server configuration values

   Default: com.mysql.cj.core.util.PerVmServerConfigCacheFactory

   Since version: 5.1.1

   alwaysSendSetIsolation

   Should the driver always communicate with the database when
   Connection.setTransactionIsolation() is called? If set to
   false, the driver will only communicate with the database
   when the requested transaction isolation is different than
   the whichever is newer, the last value that was set via
   Connection.setTransactionIsolation(), or the value that was
   read from the server when the connection was established.
   Note that useLocalSessionState=true will force the same
   behavior as alwaysSendSetIsolation=false, regardless of how
   alwaysSendSetIsolation is set.

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.7

   maintainTimeStats

   Should the driver maintain various internal timers to enable
   idle time calculations as well as more verbose error messages
   when the connection to the server fails? Setting this
   property to false removes at least two calls to
   System.getCurrentTimeMillis() per query.

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.9

   useCursorFetch

   If connected to MySQL > 5.0.2, and setFetchSize() > 0 on a
   statement, should that statement use cursor-based fetching to
   retrieve rows?

   Since version: 5.0.0

   cacheCallableStmts

   Should the driver cache the parsing stage of
   CallableStatements

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.2

   cachePrepStmts

   Should the driver cache the parsing stage of
   PreparedStatements of client-side prepared statements, the
   "check" for suitability of server-side prepared and
   server-side prepared statements themselves?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.10

   cacheResultSetMetadata

   Should the driver cache ResultSetMetaData for Statements and
   PreparedStatements? (Req. JDK-1.4+, true/false, default
   'false')

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.1

   cacheServerConfiguration

   'SHOW COLLATION' on a per-URL basis?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.5

   defaultFetchSize

   The driver will call setFetchSize(n) with this value on all
   newly-created Statements

   Default: 0

   Since version: 3.1.9

   dontCheckOnDuplicateKeyUpdateInSQL

   Stops checking if every INSERT statement contains the "ON
   DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE" clause. As a side effect, obtaining the
   statement's generated keys information will return a list
   where normally it wouldn't. Also be aware that, in this case,
   the list of generated keys returned may not be accurate. The
   effect of this property is canceled if set simultaneously
   with 'rewriteBatchedStatements=true'.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.32

   elideSetAutoCommits

   If using MySQL-4.1 or newer, should the driver only issue
   'set autocommit=n' queries when the server's state doesn't
   match the requested state by
   Connection.setAutoCommit(boolean)?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.3

   enableEscapeProcessing

   Sets the default escape processing behavior for Statement
   objects. The method Statement.setEscapeProcessing() can be
   used to specify the escape processing behavior for an
   individual Statement object. Default escape processing
   behavior in prepared statements must be defined with the
   property 'processEscapeCodesForPrepStmts'.

   Default: true

   Since version: 6.0.1

   enableQueryTimeouts

   When enabled, query timeouts set via
   Statement.setQueryTimeout() use a shared java.util.Timer
   instance for scheduling. Even if the timeout doesn't expire
   before the query is processed, there will be memory used by
   the TimerTask for the given timeout which won't be reclaimed
   until the time the timeout would have expired if it hadn't
   been cancelled by the driver. High-load environments might
   want to consider disabling this functionality.

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.0.6

   largeRowSizeThreshold

   What size result set row should the JDBC driver consider
   "large", and thus use a more memory-efficient way of
   representing the row internally?

   Default: 2048

   Since version: 5.1.1

   readOnlyPropagatesToServer

   Should the driver issue appropriate statements to implicitly
   set the transaction access mode on server side when
   Connection.setReadOnly() is called? Setting this property to
   'true' enables InnoDB read-only potential optimizations but
   also requires an extra roundtrip to set the right transaction
   state. Even if this property is set to 'false', the driver
   will do its best effort to prevent the execution of
   database-state-changing queries. Requires minimum of MySQL
   5.6.

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.1.35

   rewriteBatchedStatements

   Should the driver use multiqueries (irregardless of the
   setting of "allowMultiQueries") as well as rewriting of
   prepared statements for INSERT into multi-value inserts when
   executeBatch() is called? Notice that this has the potential
   for SQL injection if using plain java.sql.Statements and your
   code doesn't sanitize input correctly. Notice that for
   prepared statements, server-side prepared statements can not
   currently take advantage of this rewrite option, and that if
   you don't specify stream lengths when using
   PreparedStatement.set*Stream(), the driver won't be able to
   determine the optimum number of parameters per batch and you
   might receive an error from the driver that the resultant
   packet is too large. Statement.getGeneratedKeys() for these
   rewritten statements only works when the entire batch
   includes INSERT statements. Please be aware using
   rewriteBatchedStatements=true with INSERT .. ON DUPLICATE KEY
   UPDATE that for rewritten statement server returns only one
   value as sum of all affected (or found) rows in batch and it
   isn't possible to map it correctly to initial statements; in
   this case driver returns 0 as a result of each batch
   statement if total count was 0, and the
   Statement.SUCCESS_NO_INFO as a result of each batch statement
   if total count was > 0.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.13

   useReadAheadInput

   Use newer, optimized non-blocking, buffered input stream when
   reading from the server?

   ms) before it is logged as 'slow'?

   Default: 2000

   Since version: 3.1.2

   slowQueryThresholdNanos

   If 'useNanosForElapsedTime' is set to true, and this property
   is set to a non-zero value, the driver will use this
   threshold (in nanosecond units) to determine if a query was
   slow.

   Default: 0

   Since version: 5.0.7

   useUsageAdvisor

   Should the driver issue 'usage' warnings advising proper and
   efficient usage of JDBC and MySQL Connector/J to the log
   (true/false, defaults to 'false')?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.1

   autoGenerateTestcaseScript

   Should the driver dump the SQL it is executing, including
   server-side prepared statements to STDERR?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.9

   autoSlowLog

   Instead of using slowQueryThreshold* to determine if a query
   is slow enough to be logged, maintain statistics that allow
   the driver to determine queries that are outside the 99th
   percentile?

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.1.4

   clientInfoProvider

   The name of a class that implements the
   com.mysql.cj.api.jdbc.ClientInfoProvider interface in order

   Since version: 5.1.0

   enablePacketDebug

   When enabled, a ring-buffer of 'packetDebugBufferSize'
   packets will be kept, and dumped when exceptions are thrown
   in key areas in the driver's code

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.3

   explainSlowQueries

   If 'logSlowQueries' is enabled, should the driver
   automatically issue an 'EXPLAIN' on the server and send the
   results to the configured log at a WARN level?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.2

   logSlowQueries

   Should queries that take longer than
   'slowQueryThresholdMillis' be logged?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.2

   For profiling/debugging functionality that measures elapsed
   time, should the driver try to use nanoseconds resolution if
   available (JDK >= 1.5)?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.7

   useOnlyServerErrorMessages

   Don't prepend 'standard' SQLState error messages to error
   messages returned by the server.

   Since version: 3.1.3

   exceptionInterceptors

   Comma-delimited list of classes that implement
   com.mysql.cj.api.exceptions.ExceptionInterceptor. These
   classes will be instantiated one per Connection instance, and

   Tunes for integration with other products.
   Properties and Descriptions

   overrideSupportsIntegrityEnhancementFacility

   Should the driver return "true" for
   DatabaseMetaData.supportsIntegrityEnhancementFacility() even
   if the database doesn't support it to workaround applications
   that require this method to return "true" to signal support
   of foreign keys, even though the SQL specification states
   that this facility contains much more than just foreign key
   support (one such application being OpenOffice)?

   Since version: 2.0.3

   JDBC compliance.
   Properties and Descriptions

   useColumnNamesInFindColumn

   Prior to JDBC-4.0, the JDBC specification had a bug related
   to what could be given as a "column name" to ResultSet
   methods like findColumn(), or getters that took a String
   property. JDBC-4.0 clarified "column name" to mean the label,
   as given in an "AS" clause and returned by
   ResultSetMetaData.getColumnLabel(), and if no AS clause, the
   column name. Setting this property to "true" will give
   behavior that is congruent to JDBC-3.0 and earlier versions
   of the JDBC specification, but which because of the
   specification bug could give unexpected results. This
   property is preferred over "useOldAliasMetadataBehavior"
   unless you need the specific behavior that it provides with
   respect to ResultSetMetadata.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.7

   pedantic

   Follow the JDBC spec to the letter.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.0

   Should the driver use the legacy behavior for "AS" clauses on
   columns and tables, and only return aliases (if any) for
   ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName() or
   ResultSetMetaData.getTableName() rather than the original
   column/table name? In 5.0.x, the default value was true.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.4

   X Protocol and X DevAPI.
   Properties and Descriptions

   Since version: 6.0.0

   Connector/J also supports access to MySQL using named pipes
   on Windows platforms with the NamedPipeSocketFactory as a
   plugin-socket factory. If you do not use a namedPipePath
   property, the default of '\\.\pipe\MySQL' is used. If you use
   the NamedPipeSocketFactory, the host name and port number
   values in the JDBC URL are ignored. To enable this feature,
   set the socketFactory property:
socketFactory=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.NamedPipeSocketFactory

   Named pipes only work when connecting to a MySQL server on
   the same physical machine where the JDBC driver is running.
   In simple performance tests, named pipe access is between
   30%-50% faster than the standard TCP/IP access. However, this
   varies per system, and named pipes are slower than TCP/IP in
   many Windows configurations.

   To create your own socket factories, follow the example code
   in com.mysql.cj.core.io.NamedPipeSocketFactory, or
   com.mysql.cj.core.io.StandardSocketFactory.

6.1.1 Properties Files for the useConfigs Option

   The useConfigs connection option is convenient shorthand for
   specifying combinations of options for particular scenarios.
   The argument values you can use with this option correspond
   to the names of .properties files within the Connector/J
   mysql-connector-java-version-bin.jar JAR file. For example,
   the Connector/J 6.0.0 driver includes the following
   configuration properties files:
$ unzip mysql-connector-java-6.0.0-bin.jar '*/configs/*'
Archive:  mysql-connector-java-6.0.0-bin.jar
   creating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/
  inflating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/3-0-Compat.properties
  inflating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/5-0-Compat.properties
  inflating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/clusterBase.properties

  inflating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/fullDebug.properties
  inflating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/maxPerformance.properties
  inflating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/solarisMaxPerformance.properties

   To specify one of these combinations of options, specify
   useConfigs=3-0-Compat, useConfigs=maxPerformance, and so on.
   The following sections show the options that are part of each
   useConfigs setting. For the details of why each one is
   included, see the comments in the .properties files.

6.2 JDBC API Implementation Notes

   MySQL Connector/J, as a rigorous implementation of the JDBC
   API
   (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/index.htm
   l), passes all of the tests in the publicly available version
   of Oracle's JDBC compliance test suite. The JDBC
   specification is flexible on how certain functionality should
   be implemented. This section gives details on an
   interface-by-interface level about implementation decisions
   that might affect how you code applications with MySQL
   Connector/J.

     * BLOB
       You can emulate BLOBs with locators by adding the
       property emulateLocators=true to your JDBC URL. Using
       this method, the driver will delay loading the actual
       BLOB data until you retrieve the other data and then use
       retrieval methods (getInputStream(), getBytes(), and so
       forth) on the BLOB data stream.
       You must use a column alias with the value of the column
       to the actual name of the BLOB, for example:
SELECT id, 'data' as blob_data from blobtable

       You must also follow these rules:

          + The SELECT
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html)
            must reference only one table. The table must have a
            primary key
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.htm
            l#glos_primary_key).

          + The SELECT
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html)
            must alias the original BLOB column name, specified
            as a string, to an alternate name.

          + The SELECT
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html)
            must cover all columns that make up the primary key.
       The BLOB implementation does not allow in-place
       modification (they are copies, as reported by the
       DatabaseMetaData.locatorsUpdateCopies() method). Because
       of this, use the corresponding
       PreparedStatement.setBlob() or ResultSet.updateBlob() (in
       the case of updatable result sets) methods to save
       changes back to the database.

     * CallableStatement
       Stored procedures are supported when connecting to MySQL
       using the CallableStatement interface. Currently, the
       getParameterMetaData() method of CallableStatement is not
       supported.

     * CLOB
       The CLOB implementation does not allow in-place
       modification (they are copies, as reported by the
       DatabaseMetaData.locatorsUpdateCopies() method). Because
       of this, use the PreparedStatement.setClob() method to
       save changes back to the database. The JDBC API does not
       have a ResultSet.updateClob() method.

     * Connection
       The isClosed() method does not ping the server to
       determine if it is available. In accordance with the JDBC
       specification, it only returns true if closed() has been
       called on the connection. If you need to determine if the
       connection is still valid, issue a simple query, such as
       SELECT 1. The driver will throw an exception if the
       connection is no longer valid.

     * DatabaseMetaData
       Foreign key
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glo
       s_foreign_key) information
       (getImportedKeys()/getExportedKeys() and
       getCrossReference()) is only available from InnoDB
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-storage-en
       gine.html) tables. The driver uses SHOW CREATE TABLE
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-create-table
       .html) to retrieve this information, so if any other
       storage engines add support for foreign keys, the driver
       would transparently support them as well.

     * PreparedStatement
       PreparedStatements are implemented by the driver, as
       MySQL does not have a prepared statement feature. Because
       of this, the driver does not implement
       getParameterMetaData() or getMetaData() as it would
       require the driver to have a complete SQL parser in the
       client.
       Server-side prepared statements and binary-encoded result
       sets are used when the server supports them. Be careful
       when using a server-side prepared statement with large
       parameters that are set using setBinaryStream(),
       setAsciiStream(), setUnicodeStream(), setBlob(), or
       setClob(). To re-execute the statement with any large
       parameter changed to a nonlarge parameter, call
       clearParameters() and set all parameters again. The
       reason for this is as follows:

          + During both server-side prepared statements and
            client-side emulation, large data is exchanged only
            when PreparedStatement.execute() is called.

          + Once that has been done, the stream used to read the
            data on the client side is closed (as per the JDBC
            spec), and cannot be read from again.

          + If a parameter changes from large to nonlarge, the
            driver must reset the server-side state of the
            prepared statement to allow the parameter that is
            being changed to take the place of the prior large
            value. This removes all of the large data that has
            already been sent to the server, thus requiring the
            data to be re-sent, using the setBinaryStream(),
            setAsciiStream(), setUnicodeStream(), setBlob() or
            setClob() method.
       Consequently, to change the type of a parameter to a
       nonlarge one, you must call clearParameters() and set all
       parameters of the prepared statement again before it can
       be re-executed.

     * ResultSet
       By default, ResultSets are completely retrieved and
       stored in memory. In most cases this is the most
       efficient way to operate and, due to the design of the
       MySQL network protocol, is easier to implement. If you
       are working with ResultSets that have a large number of
       rows or large values and cannot allocate heap space in
       your JVM for the memory required, you can tell the driver
       to stream the results back one row at a time.
       To enable this functionality, create a Statement instance
       in the following manner:
stmt = conn.createStatement(java.sql.ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,
              java.sql.ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
stmt.setFetchSize(Integer.MIN_VALUE);

       The combination of a forward-only, read-only result set,
       with a fetch size of Integer.MIN_VALUE serves as a signal
       to the driver to stream result sets row-by-row. After
       this, any result sets created with the statement will be
       retrieved row-by-row.
       There are some caveats with this approach. You must read
       all of the rows in the result set (or close it) before
       you can issue any other queries on the connection, or an
       exception will be thrown.
       The earliest the locks these statements hold can be
       released (whether they be MyISAM table-level locks or
       row-level locks in some other storage engine such as
       InnoDB) is when the statement completes.
       If the statement is within scope of a transaction, then
       locks are released when the transaction completes (which
       implies that the statement needs to complete first). As
       with most other databases, statements are not complete
       until all the results pending on the statement are read
       or the active result set for the statement is closed.
       Therefore, if using streaming results, process them as
       quickly as possible if you want to maintain concurrent
       access to the tables referenced by the statement
       producing the result set.

     * Statement
       Connector/J includes support for both Statement.cancel()
       and Statement.setQueryTimeout(). Both require a separate
       connection to issue the KILL QUERY
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/kill.html)
       statement. In the case of setQueryTimeout(), the
       implementation creates an additional thread to handle the
       timeout functionality.
       Note
       Failures to cancel the statement for setQueryTimeout()
       may manifest themselves as RuntimeException rather than
       failing silently, as there is currently no way to unblock
       the thread that is executing the query being cancelled
       due to timeout expiration and have it throw the exception
       instead.
       MySQL does not support SQL cursors, and the JDBC driver
       does not emulate them, so setCursorName() has no effect.
       Connector/J also supplies two additional methods:

          + setLocalInfileInputStream() sets an InputStream
            instance that will be used to send data to the MySQL
            server for a LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.ht
            ml) statement rather than a FileInputStream or
            URLInputStream that represents the path given as an
            argument to the statement.
            This stream will be read to completion upon
            execution of a LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.ht
            ml) statement, and will automatically be closed by
            the driver, so it needs to be reset before each call
            to execute*() that would cause the MySQL server to
            request data to fulfill the request for LOAD DATA
            LOCAL INFILE
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.ht
            ml).
            If this value is set to NULL, the driver will revert
            to using a FileInputStream or URLInputStream as
            required.

          + getLocalInfileInputStream() returns the InputStream
            instance that will be used to send data in response
            to a LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.ht
            ml) statement.
            This method returns NULL if no such stream has been
            set using setLocalInfileInputStream().

6.3 Java, JDBC and MySQL Types

   MySQL Connector/J is flexible in the way it handles
   conversions between MySQL data types and Java data types.

   In general, any MySQL data type can be converted to a
   java.lang.String, and any numeric type can be converted to
   any of the Java numeric types, although round-off, overflow,
   or loss of precision may occur.
   Note

   All TEXT types return Types.LONGVARCHAR with different
   getPrecision() values (65535, 255, 16777215, and 2147483647
   respectively) with getColumnType() returning -1. This
   behavior is intentional even though TINYTEXT does not fall,
   regarding to its size, within the LONGVARCHAR category. This
   is to avoid different handling inside the same base type. And
   getColumnType() returns -1 because the internal server
   handling is of type TEXT, which is similar to BLOB.

   Also note that getColumnTypeName() will return VARCHAR even
   though getColumnType() returns Types.LONGVARCHAR, because
   VARCHAR is the designated column database-specific name for
   this type.

   Connector/J issues warnings or throws DataTruncation
   exceptions as is required by the JDBC specification, unless
   the connection was configured not to do so by using the
   property jdbcCompliantTruncation and setting it to false.

   The conversions that are always guaranteed to work are listed
   in the following table. The first column lists one or more
   MySQL data types, and the second column lists one or more
   Java types to which the MySQL types can be converted.

   Table 6.1 Connection Properties - Miscellaneous
   These MySQL Data Types Can always be converted to these Java
   types
   CHAR, VARCHAR, BLOB, TEXT, ENUM, and SET java.lang.String,
   java.io.InputStream, java.io.Reader, java.sql.Blob,
   java.sql.Clob
   FLOAT, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION, NUMERIC, DECIMAL, TINYINT,
   SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INTEGER, BIGINT java.lang.String,
   java.lang.Short, java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Long,
   java.lang.Double, java.math.BigDecimal
   DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP java.lang.String,
   java.sql.Date, java.sql.Timestamp
   Note

   Round-off, overflow or loss of precision may occur if you
   choose a Java numeric data type that has less precision or
   capacity than the MySQL data type you are converting to/from.

   The ResultSet.getObject() method uses the type conversions
   between MySQL and Java types, following the JDBC
   specification where appropriate. The value returned by
   ResultSetMetaData.GetColumnClassName() is also shown below.
   For more information on the JDBC types, see the reference on
   the java.sql.Types
   (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Types.html
   ) class.

   LONGTEXT VARCHAR java.lang.String
   ENUM('value1','value2',...) CHAR java.lang.String
   SET('value1','value2',...) CHAR java.lang.String

6.4 Using Character Sets and Unicode

   All strings sent from the JDBC driver to the server are
   converted automatically from native Java Unicode form to the
   client character encoding, including all queries sent using
   Statement.execute(), Statement.executeUpdate(),
   Statement.executeQuery() as well as all PreparedStatement and
   CallableStatement parameters with the exclusion of parameters
   set using setBytes(), setBinaryStream(), setAsciiStream(),
   setUnicodeStream() and setBlob().

Number of Encodings Per Connection

   Connector/J supports a single character encoding between
   client and server, and any number of character encodings for
   data returned by the server to the client in the results.

Setting the Character Encoding

   The character encoding between client and server is
   automatically detected upon connection. You specify the
   encoding on the server using the character_set_server
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variabl
   es.html#sysvar_character_set_server). The driver
   automatically uses the encoding specified by the server. For
   more information, see Server Character Set and Collation
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-server.html).

   For example, to use 4-byte UTF-8 character sets with
   Connector/J, configure the MySQL server with
   character_set_server=utf8mb4
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variabl
   es.html#sysvar_character_set_server), and leave
   characterEncoding out of the Connector/J connection string.
   Connector/J will then autodetect the UTF-8 setting.

   To override the automatically detected encoding on the client
   side, use the characterEncoding property in the URL used to
   connect to the server.

   To allow multiple character sets to be sent from the client,
   use the UTF-8 encoding, either by configuring utf8 as the
   default server character set, or by configuring the JDBC
   driver to use UTF-8 through the characterEncoding property.

   When specifying character encodings on the client side, use
   Java-style names. The following table lists MySQL character
   set names and the corresponding Java-style names:

   Table 6.3 MySQL to Java Encoding Name Translations
   MySQL Character Set Name Java-Style Character Encoding Name
   ascii                    US-ASCII
   big5                     Big5
   gbk                      GBK
   sjis                     SJIS or Cp932
   cp932                    Cp932 or MS932
   gb2312                   EUC_CN
   ujis                     EUC_JP

   tis620                   TIS620
   cp1250                   Cp1250
   cp1251                   Cp1251
   cp1257                   Cp1257
   macroman                 MacRoman
   macce                    MacCentralEurope
   utf8                     UTF-8
   ucs2                     UnicodeBig
   Warning

   Do not issue the query set names with Connector/J, as the
   driver will not detect that the character set has changed,
   and will continue to use the character set detected during
   the initial connection setup.

6.5 Connecting Securely Using SSL

   SSL in MySQL Connector/J encrypts all data (other than the
   initial handshake) between the JDBC driver and the server.
   There is a performance penalty for enabling SSL, the severity
   of which depends on multiple factors including (but not
   limited to) the size of the query, the amount of data
   returned, the server hardware, the SSL library used, the
   network bandwidth, and so on.

   For SSL support to work, you must have the following:

     * A JRE that includes JSSE (Java Secure Sockets Extension),
       like JRE 1.8.

     * A MySQL server that supports SSL and has been compiled
       and configured to do so. For more information, see
       Building MySQL with Support for Secure Connections
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/building-with-sec
       ure-connection-support.html).

     * A client certificate (covered later in this section)

   The system works through two Java truststore files, one file
   contains the certificate information for the server
   (truststore in the examples below). The other file contains
   the certificate for the client (keystore in the examples
   below). All Java truststore files are password protected by
   supplying a suitable password to the keytool when you create
   the files. You need the file names and associated passwords
   to create an SSL connection.

   You will first need to import the MySQL server CA Certificate
   into a Java truststore. A sample MySQL server CA Certificate
   is located in the SSL subdirectory of the MySQL source
   distribution. This is what SSL will use to determine if you
   are communicating with a secure MySQL server. Alternatively,
   use the CA Certificate that you have generated or been
   provided with by your SSL provider.

   To use Java's keytool to create a truststore in the current
   directory , and import the server's CA certificate
   (cacert.pem), you can do the following (assuming that keytool
   is in your path. The keytool is typically located in the bin
   subdirectory of your JDK or JRE):
shell> keytool -import -alias mysqlServerCACert \
         -file cacert.pem -keystore truststore

   Enter the password when prompted for the keystore file.
   Interaction with keytool looks like this:
Enter keystore password:  *********
Owner: EMAILADDRESS=walrus@example.com, CN=Walrus,
       O=My Company, L=Orenburg, ST=Some-State, C=RU
Issuer: EMAILADDRESS=walrus@example.com, CN=Walrus,
       O=My Company, L=Orenburg, ST=Some-State, C=RU
Serial number: 0
Valid from:
   Fri Aug 02 16:55:53 CDT 2002 until: Sat Aug 02 16:55:53 CDT 2003
Certificate fingerprints:
    MD5:  61:91:A0:F2:03:07:61:7A:81:38:66:DA:19:C4:8D:AB
    SHA1: 25:77:41:05:D5:AD:99:8C:14:8C:CA:68:9C:2F:B8:89:C3:34:4D:6C
Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
Certificate was added to keystore

   You then have two options: either import the client
   certificate that matches the CA certificate you just
   imported, or create a new client certificate.

   Importing an existing certificate requires the certificate to
   be in DER format. You can use openssl to convert an existing
   certificate into the new format. For example:
shell> openssl x509 -outform DER -in client-cert.pem -out client.cert

   Now import the converted certificate into your keystore using
   keytool:
shell> keytool -import -file client.cert -keystore keystore -alias mys
qlClientCertificate

   To generate your own client certificate, use keytool to
   create a suitable certificate and add it to the keystore
   file:
shell> keytool -genkey -keyalg rsa \
     -alias mysqlClientCertificate -keystore keystore

   Keytool will prompt you for the following information, and
   create a keystore named keystore in the current directory.

   Respond with information that is appropriate for your
   situation:
Enter keystore password:  *********
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  Matthews
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  Software Development
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  My Company
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  Flossmoor
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  IL
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  US
Is <CN=Matthews, OU=Software Development, O=My Company,
 L=Flossmoor, ST=IL, C=US> correct?
  [no]:  y

Enter key password for <mysqlClientCertificate>
        (RETURN if same as keystore password):

   Finally, to get JSSE to use the keystore and truststore that
   you have generated, you need to set the following system
   properties when you start your JVM, replacing
   path_to_keystore_file with the full path to the keystore file
   you created, path_to_truststore_file with the path to the
   truststore file you created, and using the appropriate
   password values for each property. You can do this either on
   the command line:
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=path_to_keystore_file
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=path_to_truststore_file
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password

   Or you can set the values directly within the application:
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStore","path_to_keystore_file");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword","password");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore","path_to_truststore_file
");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword","password");

   You will also need to set useSSL to true in your connection
   parameters for MySQL Connector/J, either by adding
   useSSL=true to your URL, or by setting the property useSSL to
   true in the java.util.Properties instance you pass to
   DriverManager.getConnection().

   You can test that SSL is working by turning on JSSE debugging
   (as detailed below), and look for the following key events:

   JSSE provides debugging (to stdout) when you set the
   following system property: -Djavax.net.debug=all This will
   tell you what keystores and truststores are being used, as
   well as what is going on during the SSL handshake and
   certificate exchange. It will be helpful when trying to
   determine what is not working when trying to get an SSL
   connection to happen.

6.6 Connecting Using PAM Authentication

   Java applications using Connector/J can connect to MySQL
   servers that use the pluggable authentication module (PAM)
   authentication scheme.

   For PAM authentication to work, you must have the following:

     * A MySQL server that supports PAM authentication. See The
       PAM Authentication Plugin
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/pam-authenticatio
       n-plugin.html) for more information. Connector/J
       implements the same cleartext authentication method as in
       The Cleartext Client-Side Authentication Plugin
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/cleartext-authent
       ication-plugin.html).

     * SSL capability, as explained in Section 6.5, "Connecting
       Securely Using SSL." Because the PAM authentication
       scheme sends the original password to the server, the
       connection to the server must be encrypted.

   PAM authentication support is enabled by default in
   Connector/J 6.0, so no extra configuration is needed.

   To disable the PAM authentication feature, specify
   mysql_clear_password (the method) or
   com.mysql.cj.jdbc.authentication.MysqlClearPasswordPlugin
   (the class name) in the comma-separated list of arguments for
   the disabledAuthenticationPlugins connection option. See
   Section 6.1, "Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL Syntax and
   Configuration Properties for Connector/J" for details about
   that connection option.

6.7 Using Master/Slave Replication with ReplicationConnection

   See Section 9.3, "Configuring Master/Slave Replication with
   Connector/J" for details on the topic.

6.8 Mapping MySQL Error Numbers to JDBC SQLState Codes

   The table below provides a mapping of the MySQL error numbers
   to JDBC SQLState values.

Chapter 7 JDBC Concepts

   This section provides some general JDBC background.

7.1 Connecting to MySQL Using the JDBC DriverManager Interface

   When you are using JDBC outside of an application server, the
   DriverManager class manages the establishment of connections.

   Specify to the DriverManager which JDBC drivers to try to
   make Connections with. The easiest way to do this is to use
   Class.forName() on the class that implements the
   java.sql.Driver interface. With MySQL Connector/J, the name
   of this class is com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver. With this method,
   you could use an external configuration file to supply the
   driver class name and driver parameters to use when
   connecting to a database.

   The following section of Java code shows how you might
   register MySQL Connector/J from the main() method of your
   application. If testing this code, first read the
   installation section at Chapter 4, "Connector/J
   Installation," to make sure you have connector installed
   correctly and the CLASSPATH set up. Also, ensure that MySQL
   is configured to accept external TCP/IP connections.
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

// Notice, do not import com.mysql.cj.jdbc.*
// or you will have problems!

public class LoadDriver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // The newInstance() call is a work around for some
            // broken Java implementations

            Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            // handle the error
        }
    }
}

   After the driver has been registered with the DriverManager,
   you can obtain a Connection instance that is connected to a
   particular database by calling DriverManager.getConnection():

   Example 7.1 Connector/J: Obtaining a connection from the
   DriverManager

   If you have not already done so, please review the portion of
   Section 7.1, "Connecting to MySQL Using the JDBC
   DriverManager Interface" above before working with the
   example below.

   This example shows how you can obtain a Connection instance
   from the DriverManager. There are a few different signatures
   for the getConnection() method. Consult the API documentation
   that comes with your JDK for more specific information on how
   to use them.
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

Connection conn = null;
...
try {
    conn =
       DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/test?" +
                                   "user=minty&password=greatsqldb");

    // Do something with the Connection

   ...
} catch (SQLException ex) {
    // handle any errors
    System.out.println("SQLException: " + ex.getMessage());
    System.out.println("SQLState: " + ex.getSQLState());
    System.out.println("VendorError: " + ex.getErrorCode());
}

   Once a Connection is established, it can be used to create
   Statement and PreparedStatement objects, as well as retrieve
   metadata about the database. This is explained in the
   following sections.

7.2 Using JDBC Statement Objects to Execute SQL

   Statement objects allow you to execute basic SQL queries and
   retrieve the results through the ResultSet class, which is
   described later.

   To create a Statement instance, you call the
   createStatement() method on the Connection object you have
   retrieved using one of the DriverManager.getConnection() or
   DataSource.getConnection() methods described earlier.

   Once you have a Statement instance, you can execute a SELECT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html) query by
   calling the executeQuery(String) method with the SQL you want
   to use.

   To update data in the database, use the executeUpdate(String
   SQL) method. This method returns the number of rows matched
   by the update statement, not the number of rows that were
   modified.

   If you do not know ahead of time whether the SQL statement
   will be a SELECT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html) or an
   UPDATE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html)/INSERT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert.html), then
   you can use the execute(String SQL) method. This method will
   return true if the SQL query was a SELECT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html), or
   false if it was an UPDATE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html), INSERT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert.html), or
   DELETE (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html)
   statement. If the statement was a SELECT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html) query,
   you can retrieve the results by calling the getResultSet()
   method. If the statement was an UPDATE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html), INSERT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert.html), or
   DELETE (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html)
   statement, you can retrieve the affected rows count by
   calling getUpdateCount() on the Statement instance.

   Example 7.2 Connector/J: Using java.sql.Statement to execute
   a SELECT query
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;

// assume that conn is an already created JDBC connection (see previou
s examples)

Statement stmt = null;
ResultSet rs = null;

try {
    stmt = conn.createStatement();
    rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT foo FROM bar");

    // or alternatively, if you don't know ahead of time that
    // the query will be a SELECT...

    if (stmt.execute("SELECT foo FROM bar")) {
        rs = stmt.getResultSet();
    }

    // Now do something with the ResultSet ....
}
catch (SQLException ex){
    // handle any errors
    System.out.println("SQLException: " + ex.getMessage());
    System.out.println("SQLState: " + ex.getSQLState());
    System.out.println("VendorError: " + ex.getErrorCode());
}
finally {
    // it is a good idea to release
    // resources in a finally{} block
    // in reverse-order of their creation
    // if they are no-longer needed

    if (rs != null) {
        try {
            rs.close();
        } catch (SQLException sqlEx) { } // ignore

        rs = null;
    }

    if (stmt != null) {
        try {
            stmt.close();
        } catch (SQLException sqlEx) { } // ignore

        stmt = null;
    }
}

7.3 Using JDBC CallableStatements to Execute Stored Procedures

   Connector/J fully implements the java.sql.CallableStatement
   interface, with the exception of the getParameterMetaData()
   method.

   For more information on MySQL stored procedures, please refer
   to Using Stored Routines (Procedures and Functions)
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-routines.html)
   .

   Connector/J exposes stored procedure functionality through
   JDBC's CallableStatement interface.
   Note

   Current versions of MySQL server do not return enough
   information for the JDBC driver to provide result set
   metadata for callable statements. This means that when using
   CallableStatement, ResultSetMetaData may return NULL.

   The following example shows a stored procedure that returns
   the value of inOutParam incremented by 1, and the string
   passed in using inputParam as a ResultSet:

   Example 7.3 Connector/J: Calling Stored Procedures
CREATE PROCEDURE demoSp(IN inputParam VARCHAR(255), \
                        INOUT inOutParam INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE z INT;
    SET z = inOutParam + 1;
    SET inOutParam = z;

    SELECT inputParam;

    SELECT CONCAT('zyxw', inputParam);
END

   To use the demoSp procedure with Connector/J, follow these
   steps:

    1. Prepare the callable statement by using
       Connection.prepareCall().
       Notice that you have to use JDBC escape syntax, and that
       the parentheses surrounding the parameter placeholders
       are not optional:
       Example 7.4 Connector/J: Using Connection.prepareCall()
import java.sql.CallableStatement;

...

    //
    // Prepare a call to the stored procedure 'demoSp'
    // with two parameters
    //
    // Notice the use of JDBC-escape syntax ({call ...})
    //

    CallableStatement cStmt = conn.prepareCall("{call demoSp(?, ?)}");



    cStmt.setString(1, "abcdefg");

       Note
       Connection.prepareCall() is an expensive method, due to
       the metadata retrieval that the driver performs to
       support output parameters. For performance reasons,
       minimize unnecessary calls to Connection.prepareCall() by
       reusing CallableStatement instances in your code.

    2. Register the output parameters (if any exist)
       To retrieve the values of output parameters (parameters
       specified as OUT or INOUT when you created the stored
       procedure), JDBC requires that they be specified before
       statement execution using the various
       registerOutputParameter() methods in the
       CallableStatement interface:
       Example 7.5 Connector/J: Registering output parameters
import java.sql.Types;
...
//
// Connector/J supports both named and indexed
// output parameters. You can register output
// parameters using either method, as well
// as retrieve output parameters using either
// method, regardless of what method was
// used to register them.
//
// The following examples show how to use
// the various methods of registering
// output parameters (you should of course
// use only one registration per parameter).
//

//
// Registers the second parameter as output, and
// uses the type 'INTEGER' for values returned from
// getObject()
//

cStmt.registerOutParameter(2, Types.INTEGER);

//
// Registers the named parameter 'inOutParam', and
// uses the type 'INTEGER' for values returned from
// getObject()
//

cStmt.registerOutParameter("inOutParam", Types.INTEGER);
...


    3. Set the input parameters (if any exist)
       Input and in/out parameters are set as for
       PreparedStatement objects. However, CallableStatement
       also supports setting parameters by name:
       Example 7.6 Connector/J: Setting CallableStatement input
       parameters
...

    //
    // Set a parameter by index
    //

    cStmt.setString(1, "abcdefg");

    //
    // Alternatively, set a parameter using
    // the parameter name
    //

    cStmt.setString("inputParam", "abcdefg");

    //
    // Set the 'in/out' parameter using an index
    //

    cStmt.setInt(2, 1);

    //
    // Alternatively, set the 'in/out' parameter
    // by name
    //

    cStmt.setInt("inOutParam", 1);

...


    4. Execute the CallableStatement, and retrieve any result
       sets or output parameters.
       Although CallableStatement supports calling any of the
       Statement execute methods (executeUpdate(),
       executeQuery() or execute()), the most flexible method to
       call is execute(), as you do not need to know ahead of
       time if the stored procedure returns result sets:
       Example 7.7 Connector/J: Retrieving results and output
       parameter values
...

    boolean hadResults = cStmt.execute();

    //
    // Process all returned result sets
    //

    while (hadResults) {
        ResultSet rs = cStmt.getResultSet();

        // process result set
        ...

        hadResults = cStmt.getMoreResults();
    }

    //
    // Retrieve output parameters
    //
    // Connector/J supports both index-based and
    // name-based retrieval
    //

    int outputValue = cStmt.getInt(2); // index-based

    outputValue = cStmt.getInt("inOutParam"); // name-based

...

7.4 Retrieving AUTO_INCREMENT Column Values through JDBC

   getGeneratedKeys() is the preferred method to use if you need
   to retrieve AUTO_INCREMENT keys and through JDBC; this is
   illustrated in the first example below. The second example
   shows how you can retrieve the same value using a standard
   SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() query. The final example shows how
   updatable result sets can retrieve the AUTO_INCREMENT value
   when using the insertRow() method.

   Example 7.8 Connector/J: Retrieving AUTO_INCREMENT column
   values using Statement.getGeneratedKeys()
Statement stmt = null;
ResultSet rs = null;

try {

    //
    // Create a Statement instance that we can use for
    // 'normal' result sets assuming you have a
    // Connection 'conn' to a MySQL database already
    // available

    stmt = conn.createStatement();

    //
    // Issue the DDL queries for the table for this example
    //

    stmt.executeUpdate("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS autoIncTutorial");
    stmt.executeUpdate(
            "CREATE TABLE autoIncTutorial ("

            + "priKey INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, "

            + "dataField VARCHAR(64), PRIMARY KEY (priKey))");

    //
    // Insert one row that will generate an AUTO INCREMENT
    // key in the 'priKey' field
    //

    stmt.executeUpdate(
            "INSERT INTO autoIncTutorial (dataField) "

            + "values ('Can I Get the Auto Increment Field?')",
            Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS);

    //
    // Example of using Statement.getGeneratedKeys()
    // to retrieve the value of an auto-increment
    // value
    //

    int autoIncKeyFromApi = -1;

    rs = stmt.getGeneratedKeys();

    if (rs.next()) {
        autoIncKeyFromApi = rs.getInt(1);
    } else {

        // throw an exception from here
    }

    System.out.println("Key returned from getGeneratedKeys():"

        + autoIncKeyFromApi);
} finally {

    if (rs != null) {
        try {
            rs.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }

    if (stmt != null) {
        try {
            stmt.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }
}

   Example 7.9 Connector/J: Retrieving AUTO_INCREMENT column
   values using SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()
Statement stmt = null;
ResultSet rs = null;

try {

    //
    // Create a Statement instance that we can use for
    // 'normal' result sets.

    stmt = conn.createStatement();

    //
    // Issue the DDL queries for the table for this example
    //

    stmt.executeUpdate("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS autoIncTutorial");
    stmt.executeUpdate(
            "CREATE TABLE autoIncTutorial ("

            + "priKey INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, "

            + "dataField VARCHAR(64), PRIMARY KEY (priKey))");

    //
    // Insert one row that will generate an AUTO INCREMENT
    // key in the 'priKey' field
    //

    stmt.executeUpdate(
            "INSERT INTO autoIncTutorial (dataField) "

            + "values ('Can I Get the Auto Increment Field?')");

    //
    // Use the MySQL LAST_INSERT_ID()
    // function to do the same thing as getGeneratedKeys()
    //

    int autoIncKeyFromFunc = -1;
    rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()");

    if (rs.next()) {
        autoIncKeyFromFunc = rs.getInt(1);
    } else {
        // throw an exception from here
    }

    System.out.println("Key returned from " +
                       "'SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()': " +
                       autoIncKeyFromFunc);

} finally {

    if (rs != null) {
        try {
            rs.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }

    if (stmt != null) {
        try {
            stmt.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }
}

   Example 7.10 Connector/J: Retrieving AUTO_INCREMENT column
   values in Updatable ResultSets
Statement stmt = null;
ResultSet rs = null;

try {

    //
    // Create a Statement instance that we can use for
    // 'normal' result sets as well as an 'updatable'
    // one, assuming you have a Connection 'conn' to
    // a MySQL database already available
    //

    stmt = conn.createStatement(java.sql.ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,
                                java.sql.ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);

    //
    // Issue the DDL queries for the table for this example
    //

    stmt.executeUpdate("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS autoIncTutorial");
    stmt.executeUpdate(
            "CREATE TABLE autoIncTutorial ("

            + "priKey INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, "

            + "dataField VARCHAR(64), PRIMARY KEY (priKey))");

    //
    // Example of retrieving an AUTO INCREMENT key
    // from an updatable result set
    //

    rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT priKey, dataField "

       + "FROM autoIncTutorial");

    rs.moveToInsertRow();

    rs.updateString("dataField", "AUTO INCREMENT here?");
    rs.insertRow();

    //
    // the driver adds rows at the end
    //

    rs.last();

    //
    // We should now be on the row we just inserted
    //

    int autoIncKeyFromRS = rs.getInt("priKey");

    System.out.println("Key returned for inserted row: "

        + autoIncKeyFromRS);

} finally {

    if (rs != null) {
        try {
            rs.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }

    if (stmt != null) {
        try {
            stmt.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }
}

   Running the preceding example code should produce the
   following output:
Key returned from getGeneratedKeys(): 1
Key returned from SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID(): 1
Key returned for inserted row: 1

   At times, it can be tricky to use the SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()
   query, as that function's value is scoped to a connection.
   So, if some other query happens on the same connection, the
   value is overwritten. On the other hand, the
   getGeneratedKeys() method is scoped by the Statement
   instance, so it can be used even if other queries happen on
   the same connection, but not on the same Statement instance.

Chapter 8 Connection Pooling with Connector/J

   Connection pooling is a technique of creating and managing a
   pool of connections that are ready for use by any thread
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_th
   read) that needs them. Connection pooling can greatly
   increase the performance of your Java application, while
   reducing overall resource usage.

How Connection Pooling Works

   Most applications only need a thread to have access to a JDBC
   connection when they are actively processing a transaction
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_tr
   ansaction), which often takes only milliseconds to complete.
   When not processing a transaction, the connection sits idle.
   Connection pooling enables the idle connection to be used by
   some other thread to do useful work.

   In practice, when a thread needs to do work against a MySQL
   or other database with JDBC, it requests a connection from
   the pool. When the thread is finished using the connection,
   it returns it to the pool, so that it can be used by any
   other threads.

   When the connection is loaned out from the pool, it is used
   exclusively by the thread that requested it. From a
   programming point of view, it is the same as if your thread
   called DriverManager.getConnection() every time it needed a
   JDBC connection. With connection pooling, your thread may end
   up using either a new connection or an already-existing
   connection.

Benefits of Connection Pooling

   The main benefits to connection pooling are:

     * Reduced connection creation time.
       Although this is not usually an issue with the quick
       connection setup that MySQL offers compared to other
       databases, creating new JDBC connections still incurs
       networking and JDBC driver overhead that will be avoided
       if connections are recycled.

     * Simplified programming model.
       When using connection pooling, each individual thread can
       act as though it has created its own JDBC connection,
       allowing you to use straightforward JDBC programming
       techniques.

     * Controlled resource usage.
       If you create a new connection every time a thread needs
       one rather than using connection pooling, your
       application's resource usage can be wasteful, and it
       could lead to unpredictable behaviors for your
       application when it is under a heavy load.

Using Connection Pooling with Connector/J

   The concept of connection pooling in JDBC has been
   standardized through the JDBC 2.0 Optional interfaces, and
   all major application servers have implementations of these
   APIs that work with MySQL Connector/J.

   Generally, you configure a connection pool in your
   application server configuration files, and access it through
   the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). The following
   code shows how you might use a connection pool from an
   application deployed in a J2EE application server:

   Example 8.1 Connector/J: Using a connection pool with a J2EE
   application server
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

import javax.naming.InitialContext;
import javax.sql.DataSource;


public class MyServletJspOrEjb {

    public void doSomething() throws Exception {
        /*

         * Create a JNDI Initial context to be able to

         *  lookup  the DataSource
         *

         * In production-level code, this should be cached as

         * an instance or static variable, as it can

         * be quite expensive to create a JNDI context.
         *

         * Note: This code only works when you are using servlets

         * or EJBs in a J2EE application server. If you are

         * using connection pooling in standalone Java code, you

         * will have to create/configure datasources using whatever

         * mechanisms your particular connection pooling library

         * provides.
         */

        InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();

         /*

          * Lookup the DataSource, which will be backed by a pool

          * that the application server provides. DataSource instances

          * are also a good candidate for caching as an instance

          * variable, as JNDI lookups can be expensive as well.
          */

        DataSource ds =
          (DataSource)ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/MySQLDB");

        /*

         * The following code is what would actually be in your

         * Servlet, JSP or EJB 'service' method...where you need

         * to work with a JDBC connection.
         */

        Connection conn = null;
        Statement stmt = null;

        try {
            conn = ds.getConnection();

            /*

             * Now, use normal JDBC programming to work with

             * MySQL, making sure to close each resource when you're

             * finished with it, which permits the connection pool

             * resources to be recovered as quickly as possible
             */

            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            stmt.execute("SOME SQL QUERY");

            stmt.close();
            stmt = null;

            conn.close();
            conn = null;
        } finally {
            /*

             * close any jdbc instances here that weren't

             * explicitly closed during normal code path, so

             * that we don't 'leak' resources...
             */

            if (stmt != null) {
                try {
                    stmt.close();
                } catch (sqlexception sqlex) {
                    // ignore, as we can't do anything about it here
                }

                stmt = null;
            }

            if (conn != null) {
                try {
                    conn.close();
                } catch (sqlexception sqlex) {
                    // ignore, as we can't do anything about it here
                }

                conn = null;
            }
        }
    }
}

   As shown in the example above, after obtaining the JNDI
   InitialContext, and looking up the DataSource, the rest of
   the code follows familiar JDBC conventions.

   When using connection pooling, always make sure that
   connections, and anything created by them (such as statements
   or result sets) are closed. This rule applies no matter what
   happens in your code (exceptions, flow-of-control, and so
   forth). When these objects are closed, they can be re-used;
   otherwise, they will be stranded, which means that the MySQL
   server resources they represent (such as buffers, locks, or
   sockets) are tied up for some time, or in the worst case can
   be tied up forever.

Sizing the Connection Pool

   Each connection to MySQL has overhead (memory, CPU, context
   switches, and so forth) on both the client and server side.
   Every connection limits how many resources there are
   available to your application as well as the MySQL server.
   Many of these resources will be used whether or not the
   connection is actually doing any useful work! Connection
   pools can be tuned to maximize performance, while keeping
   resource utilization below the point where your application
   will start to fail rather than just run slower.

   The optimal size for the connection pool depends on
   anticipated load and average database transaction time. In
   practice, the optimal connection pool size can be smaller
   than you might expect. If you take Oracle's Java Petstore
   blueprint application for example, a connection pool of 15-20
   connections can serve a relatively moderate load (600
   concurrent users) using MySQL and Tomcat with acceptable
   response times.

   To correctly size a connection pool for your application,
   create load test scripts with tools such as Apache JMeter or
   The Grinder, and load test your application.

   An easy way to determine a starting point is to configure
   your connection pool's maximum number of connections to be
   unbounded, run a load test, and measure the largest amount of
   concurrently used connections. You can then work backward
   from there to determine what values of minimum and maximum
   pooled connections give the best performance for your
   particular application.

Validating Connections

   MySQL Connector/J can validate the connection by executing a
   lightweight ping against a server. In the case of
   load-balanced connections, this is performed against all
   active pooled internal connections that are retained. This is
   beneficial to Java applications using connection pools, as
   the pool can use this feature to validate connections.
   Depending on your connection pool and configuration, this
   validation can be carried out at different times:

    1. Before the pool returns a connection to the application.

    2. When the application returns a connection to the pool.

    3. During periodic checks of idle connections.

   To use this feature, specify a validation query in your
   connection pool that starts with /* ping */. Note that the
   syntax must be exactly as specified. This will cause the
   driver send a ping to the server and return a dummy
   lightweight result set. When using a ReplicationConnection or
   LoadBalancedConnection, the ping will be sent across all
   active connections.

   It is critical that the syntax be specified correctly. The
   syntax needs to be exact for reasons of efficiency, as this
   test is done for every statement that is executed:

protected static final String PING_MARKER = "/* ping */";
...
if (sql.charAt(0) == '/') {
if (sql.startsWith(PING_MARKER)) {
doPingInstead();
...


   None of the following snippets will work, because the ping
   syntax is sensitive to whitespace, capitalization, and
   placement:
sql = "/* PING */ SELECT 1";
sql = "SELECT 1 /* ping*/";
sql = "/*ping*/ SELECT 1";
sql = " /* ping */ SELECT 1";
sql = "/*to ping or not to ping*/ SELECT 1";

   All of the previous statements will issue a normal SELECT
   statement and will not be transformed into the lightweight
   ping. Further, for load-balanced connections, the statement
   will be executed against one connection in the internal pool,
   rather than validating each underlying physical connection.
   This results in the non-active physical connections assuming
   a stale state, and they may die. If Connector/J then
   re-balances, it might select a dead connection, resulting in
   an exception being passed to the application. To help prevent
   this, you can use loadBalanceValidateConnectionOnSwapServer
   to validate the connection before use.

   If your Connector/J deployment uses a connection pool that
   allows you to specify a validation query, take advantage of
   it, but ensure that the query starts exactly with /* ping */.
   This is particularly important if you are using the
   load-balancing or replication-aware features of Connector/J,
   as it will help keep alive connections which otherwise will
   go stale and die, causing problems later.

Chapter 9 Multi-Host Connections

   The following sections discuss a number of topics that
   involve multi-host connections, namely, server
   load-balancing, failover, and replication.

   Developers should know the following things about multi-host
   connections that are managed through Connector/J:

     * Each multi-host connection is a wrapper of the underlying
       physical connections.

     * Each of the underlying physical connections has its own
       session. Sessions cannot be tracked, shared, or copied,
       given the MySQL architecture.

     * Every switch between physical connections means a switch
       between sessions.

     * Within a transaction boundary, there are no switches
       between physical connections. Beyond a transaction
       boundary, there is no guarantee that a switch does not
       occur.
       Note
       If an application reuses session-scope data (for example,
       variables, SSPs) beyond a transaction boundary, failures
       are possible, as a switch between the physical
       connections (which is also a switch between sessions)
       might occur. Therefore, the application should re-prepare
       the session data and also restart the last transaction in
       case of an exception, or it should re-prepare session
       data for each new transaction if it does not want to deal
       with exception handling.

9.1 Configuring Server Failover

   MySQL Connector/J supports server failover. A failover
   happens when connection-related errors occur for an
   underlying, active connection. The connection errors are, by
   default, propagated to the client, which has to handle them
   by, for example, recreating the working objects (Statement,
   ResultSet, etc.) and restarting the processes. Sometimes, the
   driver might eventually fall back to the original host
   automatically before the client application continues to run,
   in which case the host switch is transparent and the client
   application will not even notice it.

   A connection using failover support works just like a
   standard connection: the client does not experience any
   disruptions in the failover process. This means the client
   can rely on the same connection instance even if two
   successive statements might be executed on two different
   physical hosts. However, this does not mean the client does
   not have to deal with the exception that triggered the server
   switch.

   The failover is configured at the initial setup stage of the
   server connection by the connection URL (see explanations for
   its format here):
jdbc:mysql://[primary host][:port],[secondary host 1][:port][,[seconda
ry host 2][:port]]...[/[database]]??
[?propertyName1=propertyValue1[&propertyName2=propertyValue2]...]

   The host list in the connection URL comprises of two types of
   hosts, the primary and the secondary. When starting a new
   connection, the driver always tries to connect to the primary
   host first and, if required, fails over to the secondary
   hosts on the list sequentially when communication problems
   are experienced. Even if the initial connection to the
   primary host fails and the driver gets connected to a
   secondary host, the primary host never loses its special
   status: for example, it can be configured with an access mode
   distinct from those of the secondary hosts, and it can be put
   on a higher priority when a host is to be picked during a
   failover process.

   The failover support is configured by the following
   connection properties (their functions are explained in the
   paragraphs below):

     * failOverReadOnly

     * secondsBeforeRetryMaster

     * queriesBeforeRetryMaster

     * retriesAllDown

     * autoReconnect

     * autoReconnectForPools

Configuring Connection Access Mode

   As with any standard connection, the initial connection to
   the primary host is in read/write mode. However, if the
   driver fails to establish the initial connection to the
   primary host and it automatically switches to the next host
   on the list, the access mode now depends on the value of the
   property failOverReadOnly, which is "true" by default. The
   same happens if the driver is initially connected to the
   primary host and, because of some connection failure, it
   fails over to a secondary host. Every time the connection
   falls back to the primary host, its access mode will be
   read/write, irrespective of whether or not the primary host
   has been connected to before. The connection access mode can
   be changed any time at runtime by calling the method
   Connection.setReadOnly(boolean), which partially overrides
   the property failOverReadOnly. When failOverReadOnly=false
   and the access mode is explicitly set to either true or
   false, it becomes the mode for every connection after a host
   switch, no matter what host type are being connected to; but,
   if failOverReadOnly=true, changing the access mode to
   read/write is only possible if the driver is connecting to
   the primary host; however, even if the access mode cannot be
   changed for the current connection, the driver remembers the
   client's last intention and, when falling back to the primary
   host, that is the mode that will be used. For an
   illustration, see the following successions of events with a
   two-host connection.

     * Sequence A, with failOverReadOnly=true:

         1. Connects to primary host in read/write mode

         2. Sets Connection.setReadOnly(true); primary host now
            in read-only mode

         3. Failover event; connects to secondary host in
            read-only mode

         4. Sets Connection.setReadOnly(false); secondary host
            remains in read-only mode

         5. Falls back to primary host; connection now in
            read/write mode

     * Sequence B, with failOverReadOnly=false

         1. Connects to primary host in read/write mode

         2. Sets Connection.setReadOnly(true); primary host now
            in read-only mode

         3. Failover event; connects to secondary host in
            read-only mode

         4. Set Connection.setReadOnly(false); connection to
            secondary host switches to read/write mode

         5. Falls back to primary host; connection now in
            read/write mode

   The difference between the two scenarios is in step 4: the
   access mode for the secondary host in sequence A does not
   change at that step, but the driver remembers and uses the
   set mode when falling back to the primary host, which would
   be read-only otherwise; but in sequence B, the access mode
   for the secondary host changes immediately.

Configuring Fallback to Primary Host

   As already mentioned, the primary host is special in the
   failover arrangement when it comes to the host's access mode.
   Additionally, the driver tries to fall back to the primary
   host as soon as possible by default, even if no communication
   exception occurs. Two properties, secondsBeforeRetryMaster
   and queriesBeforeRetryMaster, determine when the driver is
   ready to retry a reconnection to the primary host (the Master
   in the property names stands for the primary host of our
   connection URL, which is not necessarily a master host in a
   replication setup):

     * secondsBeforeRetryMaster determines how much time the
       driver waits before trying to fall back to the primary
       host

     * queriesBeforeRetryMaster determines the number of queries
       that are executed before the driver tries to fall back to
       the primary host. Note that for the driver, each call to
       a Statement.execute*() method increments the query
       execution counter; therefore, when calls are made to
       Statement.executeBatch() or if allowMultiQueries or
       rewriteBatchStatements are enabled, the driver may not
       have an accurate count of the actual number of queries
       executed on the server. Also, the driver calls the
       Statement.execute*() methods internally in several
       occasions. All these mean you can only use
       queriesBeforeRetryMaster only as a coarse specification
       for when to fall back to the primary host.

   In general, an attempt to fallback to the primary host is
   made when at least one of the conditions specified by the two
   properties is met, and the attempt always takes place at
   transaction boundaries. However, if auto-commit is turned
   off, the check happens only when the method
   Connection.commit() or Connection.rollback() is called. The
   automatic fallback to the primary host can be turned off by
   setting simultaneously secondsBeforeRetryMaster and
   queriesBeforeRetryMaster to "0". Setting only one of the
   properties to "0" only disables one part of the check.

Configuring Reconnection Attempts

   When establishing a new connection or when a failover event
   occurs, the driver tries to connect successively to the next
   candidate on the host list. When the end of the list has been
   reached, it restarts all over again from the beginning of the
   list; however, the primary host is skipped over, if (a) NOT
   all the secondary hosts have already been tested at least
   once, AND (b) the fallback conditions defined by
   secondsBeforeRetryMaster and queriesBeforeRetryMaster are not
   yet fulfilled. Each run-through of the whole host list,
   (which is not necessarily completed at the end of the host
   list) counts as a single connection attempt. The driver tries
   as many connection attempts as specified by the value of the
   property retriesAllDown.

Seamless Reconnection

   Although not recommended, you can make the driver perform
   failovers without invalidating the active Statement or
   ResultSet instances by setting either the parameter
   autoReconnect or autoReconnectForPools to true. This allows
   the client to continue using the same object instances after
   a failover event, without taking any exceptional measures.
   This, however, may lead to unexpected results: for example,
   if the driver is connected to the primary host with
   read/write access mode and it fails-over to a secondary host
   in real-only mode, further attempts to issue data-changing
   queries will result in errors, and the client will not be
   aware of that. This limitation is particularly relevant when
   using data streaming: after the failover, the ResultSet looks
   to be alright, but the underlying connection may have changed
   already, and no backing cursor is available anymore.

9.2 Configuring Load Balancing with Connector/J

   Connector/J has long provided an effective means to
   distribute read/write load across multiple MySQL server
   instances for Cluster or master-master replication
   deployments. You can dynamically configure load-balanced
   connections, with no service outage. In-process transactions
   are not lost, and no application exceptions are generated if
   any application is trying to use that particular server
   instance.

   The load balancing is configured at the initial setup stage
   of the server connection by the following connection URL,
   which has a similar format as the general JDBC URL for MySQL
   connection, but a specialized scheme:
jdbc:mysql:loadbalance://[host1][:port],[host2][:port][,[host3][:port]
]...[/[database]] ??
[?propertyName1=propertyValue1[&propertyName2=propertyValue2]...]

   There are two configuration properties associated with this
   functionality:

     * loadBalanceConnectionGroup - This provides the ability to
       group connections from different sources. This allows you
       to manage these JDBC sources within a single class loader
       in any combination you choose. If they use the same
       configuration, and you want to manage them as a logical
       single group, give them the same name. This is the key
       property for management: if you do not define a name
       (string) for loadBalanceConnectionGroup, you cannot
       manage the connections. All load-balanced connections
       sharing the same loadBalanceConnectionGroup value,
       regardless of how the application creates them, will be
       managed together.

     * ha.enableJMX - The ability to manage the connections is
       exposed when you define a loadBalanceConnectionGroup; but
       if you want to manage this externally, enable JMX by
       setting this property to true. This enables a JMX
       implementation, which exposes the management and
       monitoring operations of a connection group. Further,
       start your application with the
       -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote JVM flag. You can then
       perform connect and perform operations using a JMX client
       such as jconsole.

   Once a connection has been made using the correct connection
   properties, a number of monitoring properties are available:

     * Current active host count.

     * Current active physical connection count.

     * Current active logical connection count.

     * Total logical connections created.

     * Total transaction count.

   The following management operations can also be performed:

     * Add host.

     * Remove host.

   The JMX interface,
   com.mysql.cj.jdbc.jmx.LoadBalanceConnectionGroupManagerMBean,
   has the following methods:

     * int getActiveHostCount(String group);

     * int getTotalHostCount(String group);

     * long getTotalLogicalConnectionCount(String group);

     * long getActiveLogicalConnectionCount(String group);

     * long getActivePhysicalConnectionCount(String group);

     * long getTotalPhysicalConnectionCount(String group);

     * long getTotalTransactionCount(String group);

     * void removeHost(String group, String host) throws
       SQLException;

     * void stopNewConnectionsToHost(String group, String host)
       throws SQLException;

     * void addHost(String group, String host, boolean
       forExisting);

     * String getActiveHostsList(String group);

     * String getRegisteredConnectionGroups();

   The getRegisteredConnectionGroups() method returns the names
   of all connection groups defined in that class loader.

   You can test this setup with the following code:

   After compiling, the application can be started with the
   -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote flag, to enable remote
   management. jconsole can then be started. The Test main class
   will be listed by jconsole. Select this and click Connect.
   You can then navigate to the
   com.mysql.cj.jdbc.jmx.LoadBalanceConnectionGroupManager bean.
   At this point, you can click on various operations and
   examine the returned result.

   If you now had an additional instance of MySQL running on
   port 3309, you could ensure that Connector/J starts using it
   by using the addHost(), which is exposed in jconsole. Note
   that these operations can be performed dynamically without
   having to stop the application running.

   and failover, see Section 9.4, "Advanced Load-balancing and
   Failover Configuration."

9.3 Configuring Master/Slave Replication with Connector/J

   This section describe a number of features of Connector/J's
   support for replication-aware deployments.

   The replication is configured at the initial setup stage of
   the server connection by the connection URL, which has a
   similar format as the general JDBC URL for MySQL connection,
   but a specialized scheme:
jdbc:mysql:replication://[master host][:port],[slave host 1][:port][,[
slave host 2][:port]]...[/[database]] ??
[?propertyName1=propertyValue1[&propertyName2=propertyValue2]...]

   Users may specify the property
   allowMasterDownConnections=true to allow Connection objects
   to be created even though no master hosts are reachable. Such
   Connection objects report they are read-only, and
   isMasterConnection() returns false for them. The Connection
   tests for available master hosts when
   Connection.setReadOnly(false) is called, throwing an
   SQLException if it cannot establish a connection to a master,
   or switching to a master connection if the host is available.

   Users may specify the property
   allowSlavesDownConnections=true to allow Connection objects
   to be created even though no slave hosts are reachable. A
   Connection then, at runtime, tests for available slave hosts
   when Connection.setReadOnly(true) is called (see explanation
   for the method below), throwing an SQLException if it cannot
   establish a connection to a slave, unless the property
   readFromMasterWhenNoSlaves is set to be "true" (see below for
   a description of the property).

Scaling out Read Load by Distributing Read Traffic to Slaves

   Connector/J supports replication-aware connections. It can
   automatically send queries to a read/write master, or a
   failover or round-robin loadbalanced set of slaves based on
   the state of Connection.getReadOnly().

   An application signals that it wants a transaction to be
   read-only by calling Connection.setReadOnly(true). The
   replication-aware connection will use one of the slave
   connections, which are load-balanced per slave host using a
   round-robin scheme. A given connection is sticky to a slave
   until a transaction boundary command (a commit or rollback)
   is issued, or until the slave is removed from service. After
   calling Connection.setReadOnly(true), if you want to allow
   connection to a master when no slaves are available, set the
   property readFromMasterWhenNoSlaves to "true." Notice that
   the master host will be used in read-only state in those
   cases, as if it is a slave host. Also notice that setting
   readFromMasterWhenNoSlaves=true might result in an extra load
   for the master host in a transparent manner.

   If you have a write transaction, or if you have a read that
   is time-sensitive (remember, replication in MySQL is
   asynchronous), set the connection to be not read-only, by
   calling Connection.setReadOnly(false) and the driver will
   ensure that further calls are sent to the master MySQL
   server. The driver takes care of propagating the current
   state of autocommit, isolation level, and catalog between all
   of the connections that it uses to accomplish this load
   balancing functionality.

   To enable this functionality, use the specialized replication
   scheme ( jdbc:mysql:replication://) when connecting to the
   server.

   Here is a short example of how a replication-aware connection
   might be used in a standalone application:
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.util.Properties;
import java.sql.DriverManager;

public class ReplicationDemo {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    Properties props = new Properties();

    // We want this for failover on the slaves
    props.put("autoReconnect", "true");

    // We want to load balance between the slaves
    props.put("roundRobinLoadBalance", "true");

    props.put("user", "foo");
    props.put("password", "bar");

    //
    // Looks like a normal MySQL JDBC url, with a
    // comma-separated list of hosts, the first
    // being the 'master', the rest being any number
    // of slaves that the driver will load balance against
    //

    Connection conn =
        DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql:replication://master,s
lave1,slave2,slave3/test",
            props);

    //
    // Perform read/write work on the master
    // by setting the read-only flag to "false"
    //

    conn.setReadOnly(false);
    conn.setAutoCommit(false);
    conn.createStatement().executeUpdate("UPDATE some_table ....");
    conn.commit();

    //
    // Now, do a query from a slave, the driver automatically picks on
e
    // from the list
    //

    conn.setReadOnly(true);

    ResultSet rs =
      conn.createStatement().executeQuery("SELECT a,b FROM alt_table")
;

     .......
  }
}

   Consider using the Load Balancing JDBC Pool (lbpool) tool,
   which provides a wrapper around the standard JDBC driver and
   enables you to use DB connection pools that includes checks
   for system failures and uneven load distribution. For more
   information, see Load Balancing JDBC Driver for MySQL
   (mysql-lbpool) (http://code.google.com/p/mysql-lbpool/).

Support for Multiple-Master Replication Topographies

   Connector/J supports multi-master replication topographies.

   The connection URL for replication discussed earlier (i.e.,
   in the format of
   jdbc:mysql:replication://master,slave1,slave2,slave3/test)
   assumes that the first (and only the first) host is the
   master. Supporting deployments with an arbitrary number of
   masters and slaves requires a different URL syntax for
   specifying the hosts and the properties for specific hosts,
   which is just an expansion of the URL syntax discussed in
   Section 6.1, "" with the property type=[master|slave]; for
   example:
jdbc:mysql://address=(type=master)(host=master1host),address=(type=mas
ter)(host=master2host),address=(type=slave)(host=slave1host)/database

   Connector/J uses a load-balanced connection internally for
   management of the master connections, which means that
   ReplicationConnection, when configured to use multiple
   masters, exposes the same options to balance load across
   master hosts as described in Section 9.2, "Configuring Load
   Balancing with Connector/J."

Live Reconfiguration of Replication Topography

   Connector/J also supports live management of replication host
   (single or multi-master) topographies. This enables users to
   promote slaves for Java applications without requiring an
   application restart.

   The replication hosts are most effectively managed in the
   context of a replication connection group. A
   ReplicationConnectionGroup class represents a logical
   grouping of connections which can be managed together. There
   may be one or more such replication connection groups in a
   given Java class loader (there can be an application with two
   different JDBC resources needing to be managed
   independently). This key class exposes host management
   methods for replication connections, and
   ReplicationConnection objects register themselves with the
   appropriate ReplicationConnectionGroup if a value for the new
   replicationConnectionGroup property is specified. The
   ReplicationConnectionGroup object tracks these connections
   until they are closed, and it is used to manipulate the hosts
   associated with these connections.

   Some important methods related to host management include:

     * getMasterHosts(): Returns a collection of strings
       representing the hosts configured as masters

     * getSlaveHosts(): Returns a collection of strings
       representing the hosts configured as slaves

     * addSlaveHost(String host): Adds new host to pool of
       possible slave hosts for selection at start of new
       read-only workload

     * promoteSlaveToMaster(String host): Removes the host from
       the pool of potential slaves for future read-only
       processes (existing read-only process is allowed to
       continue to completion) and adds the host to the pool of
       potential master hosts

     * removeSlaveHost(String host, boolean closeGently):
       Removes the host (host name match must be exact) from the
       list of configured slaves; if closeGently is false,
       existing connections which have this host as currently
       active will be closed hardly (application should expect
       exceptions)

     * removeMasterHost(String host, boolean closeGently): Same
       as removeSlaveHost(), but removes the host from the list
       of configured masters

   Some useful management metrics include:

     * getConnectionCountWithHostAsSlave(String host): Returns
       the number of ReplicationConnection objects that have the
       given host configured as a possible slave

     * getConnectionCountWithHostAsMaster(String host): Returns
       the number of ReplicationConnection objects that have the
       given host configured as a possible master

     * getNumberOfSlavesAdded(): Returns the number of times a
       slave host has been dynamically added to the group pool

     * getNumberOfSlavesRemoved(): Returns the number of times a
       slave host has been dynamically removed from the group
       pool

     * getNumberOfSlavePromotions(): Returns the number of times
       a slave host has been promoted to a master

     * getTotalConnectionCount(): Returns the number of
       ReplicationConnection objects which have been registered
       with this group

     * getActiveConnectionCount(): Returns the number of
       ReplicationConnection objects currently being managed by
       this group

ReplicationConnectionGroupManager

   com.mysql.cj.jdbc.ha.ReplicationConnectionGroupManager
   provides access to the replication connection groups,
   together with some utility methods.

     * getConnectionGroup(String groupName): Returns the
       ReplicationConnectionGroup object matching the groupName
       provided

   The other methods in ReplicationConnectionGroupManager mirror
   those of ReplicationConnectionGroup, except that the first
   argument is a String group name. These methods will operate
   on all matching ReplicationConnectionGroups, which are
   helpful for removing a server from service and have it
   decommissioned across all possible
   ReplicationConnectionGroups.

   These methods might be useful for in-JVM management of
   replication hosts if an application triggers topography
   changes. For managing host configurations from outside the
   JVM, JMX can be used.

Using JMX for Managing Replication Hosts

   When Connector/J is started with ha.enableJMX=true and a
   value set for the property replicationConnectionGroup, a JMX
   MBean will be registered, allowing manipulation of
   replication hosts by a JMX client. The MBean interface is
   defined in
   com.mysql.cj.jdbc.jmx.ReplicationGroupManagerMBean, and
   leverages the ReplicationConnectionGroupManager static
   methods:
 public abstract void addSlaveHost(String groupFilter, String host) th
rows SQLException;
 public abstract void removeSlaveHost(String groupFilter, String host)
 throws SQLException;
 public abstract void promoteSlaveToMaster(String groupFilter, String
host) throws SQLException;
 public abstract void removeMasterHost(String groupFilter, String host
) throws SQLException;
 public abstract String getMasterHostsList(String group);
 public abstract String getSlaveHostsList(String group);
 public abstract String getRegisteredConnectionGroups();
 public abstract int getActiveMasterHostCount(String group);
 public abstract int getActiveSlaveHostCount(String group);
 public abstract int getSlavePromotionCount(String group);
 public abstract long getTotalLogicalConnectionCount(String group);
 public abstract long getActiveLogicalConnectionCount(String group);

9.4 Advanced Load-balancing and Failover Configuration

   Connector/J provides a useful load-balancing implementation
   for MySQL Cluster or multi-master deployments, as explained
   in Section 9.2, "Configuring Load Balancing with Connector/J"
   and Section 9.3, "." This same implementation is used for
   balancing load between read-only slaves for replication-aware
   connections.

   When trying to balance workload between multiple servers, the
   driver has to determine when it is safe to swap servers,
   doing so in the middle of a transaction, for example, could
   cause problems. It is important not to lose state
   information. For this reason, Connector/J will only try to
   pick a new server when one of the following happens:

    1. At transaction boundaries (transactions are explicitly
       committed or rolled back).

    2. A communication exception (SQL State starting with "08")
       is encountered.

    3. When a SQLException matches conditions defined by user,
       using the extension points defined by the
       loadBalanceSQLStateFailover,
       loadBalanceSQLExceptionSubclassFailover or
       loadBalanceExceptionChecker properties.

   The third condition revolves around three properties, which
   allow you to control which SQLExceptions trigger failover:

     * loadBalanceExceptionChecker - The
       loadBalanceExceptionChecker property is really the key.
       This takes a fully-qualified class name which implements
       the new com.mysql.cj.jdbc.LoadBalanceExceptionChecker
       interface. This interface is very simple, and you only
       need to implement the following method:
public boolean shouldExceptionTriggerFailover(SQLException ex)

       A SQLException is passed in, and a boolean returned. A
       value of true triggers a failover, false does not.
       You can use this to implement your own custom logic. An
       example where this might be useful is when dealing with
       transient errors when using MySQL Cluster, where certain
       buffers may become overloaded. The following code snippet
       illustrates this:

public class NdbLoadBalanceExceptionChecker
 extends StandardLoadBalanceExceptionChecker {

 public boolean shouldExceptionTriggerFailover(SQLException ex) {
  return super.shouldExceptionTriggerFailover(ex)
    ||  checkNdbException(ex);
 }

 private boolean checkNdbException(SQLException ex){
 // Have to parse the message since most NDB errors
 // are mapped to the same DEMC.
  return (ex.getMessage().startsWith("Lock wait timeout exceeded") ||
  (ex.getMessage().startsWith("Got temporary error")
  && ex.getMessage().endsWith("from NDB")));
 }
}


       The code above extends
       com.mysql.cj.jdbc.StandardLoadBalanceExceptionChecker,
       which is the default implementation. There are a few
       convenient shortcuts built into this, for those who want
       to have some level of control using properties, without
       writing Java code. This default implementation uses the
       two remaining properties: loadBalanceSQLStateFailover and
       loadBalanceSQLExceptionSubclassFailover.

     * loadBalanceSQLStateFailover - allows you to define a
       comma-delimited list of SQLState code prefixes, against
       which a SQLException is compared. If the prefix matches,
       failover is triggered. So, for example, the following
       would trigger a failover if a given SQLException starts
       with "00", or is "12345":
loadBalanceSQLStateFailover=00,12345


     * loadBalanceSQLExceptionSubclassFailover - can be used in
       conjunction with loadBalanceSQLStateFailover or on its
       own. If you want certain subclasses of SQLException to
       trigger failover, simply provide a comma-delimited list
       of fully-qualified class or interface names to check
       against. For example, if you want all
       SQLTransientConnectionExceptions to trigger failover, you
       would specify:
loadBalanceSQLExceptionSubclassFailover=java.sql.SQLTransientConnectio
nException

   While the three failover conditions enumerated earlier suit
   most situations, if autocommit is enabled, Connector/J never
   re-balances, and continues using the same physical
   connection. This can be problematic, particularly when
   load-balancing is being used to distribute read-only load
   across multiple slaves. However, Connector/J can be
   configured to re-balance after a certain number of statements
   are executed, when autocommit is enabled. This functionality
   is dependent upon the following properties:

     * loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementThreshold - defines the
       number of matching statements which will trigger the
       driver to potentially swap physical server connections.
       The default value, 0, retains the behavior that
       connections with autocommit enabled are never balanced.

     * loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementRegex - the regular
       expression against which statements must match. The
       default value, blank, matches all statements. So, for
       example, using the following properties will cause
       Connector/J to re-balance after every third statement
       that contains the string "test":
loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementThreshold=3
loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementRegex=.*test.*

       loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementRegex can prove useful in a
       number of situations. Your application may use temporary
       tables, server-side session state variables, or
       connection state, where letting the driver arbitrarily
       swap physical connections before processing is complete
       could cause data loss or other problems. This allows you
       to identify a trigger statement that is only executed
       when it is safe to swap physical connections.

Chapter 10 Using the Connector/J Interceptor Classes

   An interceptor is a software design pattern that provides a
   transparent way to extend or modify some aspect of a program,
   similar to a user exit. No recompiling is required. With
   Connector/J, the interceptors are enabled and disabled by
   updating the connection string to refer to different sets of
   interceptor classes that you instantiate.

   The connection properties that control the interceptors are
   explained in Section 6.1, "Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL
   Syntax and Configuration Properties for Connector/J:"

     * connectionLifecycleInterceptors, where you specify the
       fully qualified names of classes that implement the
       com.mysql.cj.api.jdbc.interceptors.ConnectionLifecycleInt
       erceptor interface. In these kinds of interceptor
       classes, you might log events such as rollbacks, measure
       the time between transaction start and end, or count
       events such as calls to setAutoCommit().

     * exceptionInterceptors, where you specify the fully
       qualified names of classes that implement the
       com.mysql.cj.api.exceptions.ExceptionInterceptor
       interface. In these kinds of interceptor classes, you
       might add extra diagnostic information to exceptions that
       can have multiple causes or indicate a problem with
       server settings. exceptionInterceptors classes are called
       when handling an Exception thrown from Connector/J code.

     * statementInterceptors, where you specify the fully
       qualified names of classes that implement the
       com.mysql.cj.api.jdbc.interceptors.StatementInterceptorV2
       interface. In these kinds of interceptor classes, you
       might change or augment the processing done by certain
       kinds of statements, such as automatically checking for
       queried data in a memcached server, rewriting slow
       queries, logging information about statement execution,
       or route requests to remote servers.

Chapter 11 Using Connector/J with Tomcat

   The following instructions are based on the instructions for
   Tomcat-5.x, available at
   http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/jndi-datasource-examp
   les-howto.html which is current at the time this document was
   written.

   First, install the .jar file that comes with Connector/J in
   $CATALINA_HOME/common/lib so that it is available to all
   applications installed in the container.

   Next, configure the JNDI DataSource by adding a declaration
   resource to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml in the context
   that defines your web application:
  <Context ....>

  ...

  <Resource name="jdbc/MySQLDB"
               auth="Container"
               type="javax.sql.DataSource"/>

  <ResourceParams name="jdbc/MySQLDB">
    <parameter>
      <name>factory</name>
      <value>org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSourceFactory</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>maxActive</name>
      <value>10</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>maxIdle</name>
      <value>5</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>validationQuery</name>
      <value>SELECT 1</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>testOnBorrow</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>testWhileIdle</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis</name>
      <value>10000</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>minEvictableIdleTimeMillis</name>
      <value>60000</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
     <name>username</name>
     <value>someuser</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
     <name>password</name>
     <value>somepass</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
       <name>driverClassName</name>
       <value>com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>url</name>
      <value>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test</value>
    </parameter>

  </ResourceParams>
</Context>

   Connector/J introduces a facility whereby, rather than use a
   validationQuery value of SELECT 1, it is possible to use
   validationQuery with a value set to /* ping */. This sends a
   ping to the server which then returns a fake result set. This
   is a lighter weight solution. It also has the advantage that
   if using ReplicationConnection or LoadBalancedConnection type
   connections, the ping will be sent across all active
   connections. The following XML snippet illustrates how to
   select this option:

<parameter>
 <name>validationQuery</name>
 <value>/* ping */</value>
</parameter>


   Note that /* ping */ has to be specified exactly.

   In general, follow the installation instructions that come
   with your version of Tomcat, as the way you configure
   datasources in Tomcat changes from time to time, and if you
   use the wrong syntax in your XML file, you will most likely
   end up with an exception similar to the following:
Error: java.sql.SQLException: Cannot load JDBC driver class 'null ' SQ

state: null

   Note that the auto-loading of drivers having the
   META-INF/service/java.sql.Driver class in JDBC 4.0 and later
   causes an improper undeployment of the Connector/J driver in
   Tomcat on Windows. Namely, the Connector/J jar remains
   locked. This is an initialization problem that is not related
   to the driver. The possible workarounds, if viable, are as
   follows: use "antiResourceLocking=true" as a Tomcat Context
   attribute, or remove the META-INF/ directory.

Chapter 12 Using Connector/J with JBoss

   These instructions cover JBoss-4.x. To make the JDBC driver
   classes available to the application server, copy the .jar
   file that comes with Connector/J to the lib directory for
   your server configuration (which is usually called default).
   Then, in the same configuration directory, in the
   subdirectory named deploy, create a datasource configuration
   file that ends with -ds.xml, which tells JBoss to deploy this
   file as a JDBC Datasource. The file should have the following
   contents:
<datasources>
    <local-tx-datasource>

        <jndi-name>MySQLDB</jndi-name>
        <connection-url>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dbname</connection
-url>
        <driver-class>com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver</driver-class>
        <user-name>user</user-name>
        <password>pass</password>

        <min-pool-size>5</min-pool-size>

        <max-pool-size>20</max-pool-size>

        <idle-timeout-minutes>5</idle-timeout-minutes>

        <exception-sorter-class-name>
  com.mysql.cj.jdbc.integration.jboss.ExtendedMysqlExceptionSorter
        </exception-sorter-class-name>
        <valid-connection-checker-class-name>
  com.mysql.cj.jdbc.integration.jboss.MysqlValidConnectionChecker
        </valid-connection-checker-class-name>

    </local-tx-datasource>
</datasources>

Chapter 13 Using Connector/J with Spring

   The Spring Framework is a Java-based application framework
   designed for assisting in application design by providing a
   way to configure components. The technique used by Spring is
   a well known design pattern called Dependency Injection (see
   Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection
   pattern
   (http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html)). This
   article will focus on Java-oriented access to MySQL databases
   with Spring 2.0. For those wondering, there is a .NET port of
   Spring appropriately named Spring.NET.

   Spring is not only a system for configuring components, but
   also includes support for aspect oriented programming (AOP).
   This is one of the main benefits and the foundation for
   Spring's resource and transaction management. Spring also
   provides utilities for integrating resource management with
   JDBC and Hibernate.

   For the examples in this section the MySQL world sample
   database will be used. The first task is to set up a MySQL
   data source through Spring. Components within Spring use the
   "bean" terminology. For example, to configure a connection to
   a MySQL server supporting the world sample database, you
   might use:

<util:map id="dbProps">
    <entry key="db.driver" value="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"/>
    <entry key="db.jdbcurl" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost/world"/>
    <entry key="db.username" value="myuser"/>
    <entry key="db.password" value="mypass"/>
</util:map>


   In the above example, we are assigning values to properties
   that will be used in the configuration. For the datasource
   configuration:

<bean id="dataSource"
       class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSou
rce">
    <property name="driverClassName" value="${db.driver}"/>
    <property name="url" value="${db.jdbcurl}"/>
    <property name="username" value="${db.username}"/>
    <property name="password" value="${db.password}"/>
</bean>


   The placeholders are used to provide values for properties of
   this bean. This means that we can specify all the properties
   of the configuration in one place instead of entering the
   values for each property on each bean. We do, however, need
   one more bean to pull this all together. The last bean is
   responsible for actually replacing the placeholders with the
   property values.

<bean
 class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderCo
nfigurer">
    <property name="properties" ref="dbProps"/>
</bean>


   Now that we have our MySQL data source configured and ready
   to go, we write some Java code to access it. The example
   below will retrieve three random cities and their
   corresponding country using the data source we configured
   with Spring.
// Create a new application context. this processes the Spring config
ApplicationContext ctx =
    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("ex1appContext.xml");
// Retrieve the data source from the application context
    DataSource ds = (DataSource) ctx.getBean("dataSource");
// Open a database connection using Spring's DataSourceUtils
Connection c = DataSourceUtils.getConnection(ds);
try {
    // retrieve a list of three random cities
    PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(
        "select City.Name as 'City', Country.Name as 'Country' " +
        "from City inner join Country on City.CountryCode = Country.Co
de " +
        "order by rand() limit 3");
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while(rs.next()) {
        String city = rs.getString("City");
        String country = rs.getString("Country");
        System.out.printf("The city %s is in %s%n", city, country);
    }
} catch (SQLException ex) {
    // something has failed and we print a stack trace to analyse the
error
    ex.printStackTrace();
    // ignore failure closing connection
    try { c.close(); } catch (SQLException e) { }
} finally {
    // properly release our connection
    DataSourceUtils.releaseConnection(c, ds);
}

   This is very similar to normal JDBC access to MySQL with the
   main difference being that we are using DataSourceUtils
   instead of the DriverManager to create the connection.

   While it may seem like a small difference, the implications
   are somewhat far reaching. Spring manages this resource in a
   way similar to a container managed data source in a J2EE
   application server. When a connection is opened, it can be
   subsequently accessed in other parts of the code if it is
   synchronized with a transaction. This makes it possible to
   treat different parts of your application as transactional
   instead of passing around a database connection.

13.1 Using JdbcTemplate

   Spring makes extensive use of the Template method design
   pattern (see Template Method Pattern
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern)). Our
   immediate focus will be on the JdbcTemplate and related
   classes, specifically NamedParameterJdbcTemplate. The
   template classes handle obtaining and releasing a connection
   for data access when one is needed.

   The next example shows how to use NamedParameterJdbcTemplate
   inside of a DAO (Data Access Object) class to retrieve a
   random city given a country code.
public class Ex2JdbcDao {
     /**

     * Data source reference which will be provided by Spring.
     */
     private DataSource dataSource;

     /**

     * Our query to find a random city given a country code. Notice

     * the ":country" parameter toward the end. This is called a

     * named parameter.
     */
     private String queryString = "select Name from City " +
        "where CountryCode = :country order by rand() limit 1";

     /**

     * Retrieve a random city using Spring JDBC access classes.
     */
     public String getRandomCityByCountryCode(String cntryCode) {
         // A template that permits using queries with named parameter
s
         NamedParameterJdbcTemplate template =
         new NamedParameterJdbcTemplate(dataSource);
         // A java.util.Map is used to provide values for the paramete
rs
         Map params = new HashMap();
         params.put("country", cntryCode);
         // We query for an Object and specify what class we are expec
ting
         return (String)template.queryForObject(queryString, params, S
tring.class);
     }

    /**

    * A JavaBean setter-style method to allow Spring to inject the dat
a source.

    * @param dataSource
    */
    public void setDataSource(DataSource dataSource) {
        this.dataSource = dataSource;
    }
}

   The focus in the above code is on the
   getRandomCityByCountryCode() method. We pass a country code
   and use the NamedParameterJdbcTemplate to query for a city.
   The country code is placed in a Map with the key "country",
   which is the parameter is named in the SQL query.

   To access this code, you need to configure it with Spring by
   providing a reference to the data source.

<bean id="dao" class="code.Ex2JdbcDao">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>


   At this point, we can just grab a reference to the DAO from
   Spring and call getRandomCityByCountryCode().
    // Create the application context
    ApplicationContext ctx =
    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("ex2appContext.xml");
    // Obtain a reference to our DAO
    Ex2JdbcDao dao = (Ex2JdbcDao) ctx.getBean("dao");

    String countryCode = "USA";

    // Find a few random cities in the US
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
        System.out.printf("A random city in %s is %s%n", countryCode,
            dao.getRandomCityByCountryCode(countryCode));

   This example shows how to use Spring's JDBC classes to
   completely abstract away the use of traditional JDBC classes
   including Connection and PreparedStatement.

13.2 Transactional JDBC Access

   Spring allows us to add transactions into our code without
   having to deal directly with the JDBC classes. For that
   purpose, Spring provides a transaction management package
   that not only replaces JDBC transaction management, but also
   enables declarative transaction management (configuration
   instead of code).

   To use transactional database access, we will need to change
   the storage engine of the tables in the world database. The
   downloaded script explicitly creates MyISAM tables, which do
   not support transactional semantics. The InnoDB storage
   engine does support transactions and this is what we will be
   using. We can change the storage engine with the following
   statements.
ALTER TABLE City ENGINE=InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE Country ENGINE=InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE CountryLanguage ENGINE=InnoDB;

   A good programming practice emphasized by Spring is
   separating interfaces and implementations. What this means is
   that we can create a Java interface and only use the
   operations on this interface without any internal knowledge
   of what the actual implementation is. We will let Spring
   manage the implementation and with this it will manage the
   transactions for our implementation.

   First you create a simple interface:
public interface Ex3Dao {
    Integer createCity(String name, String countryCode,
    String district, Integer population);
}

   This interface contains one method that will create a new
   city record in the database and return the id of the new
   record. Next you need to create an implementation of this
   interface.
public class Ex3DaoImpl implements Ex3Dao {
    protected DataSource dataSource;
    protected SqlUpdate updateQuery;
    protected SqlFunction idQuery;

    public Integer createCity(String name, String countryCode,
        String district, Integer population) {
            updateQuery.update(new Object[] { name, countryCode,
                   district, population });
            return getLastId();
        }

    protected Integer getLastId() {
        return idQuery.run();
    }
}

   You can see that we only operate on abstract query objects
   here and do not deal directly with the JDBC API. Also, this
   is the complete implementation. All of our transaction
   management will be dealt with in the configuration. To get
   the configuration started, we need to create the DAO.

<bean id="dao" class="code.Ex3DaoImpl">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
    <property name="updateQuery">...</property>
    <property name="idQuery">...</property>
</bean>


   Now we need to set up the transaction configuration. The
   first thing we must do is create transaction manager to
   manage the data source and a specification of what
   transaction properties are required for the dao methods.

<bean id="transactionManager"
  class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionMana
ger">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>

<tx:advice id="txAdvice" transaction-manager="transactionManager">
    <tx:attributes>
        <tx:method name="*"/>
    </tx:attributes>
</tx:advice>


   The preceding code creates a transaction manager that handles
   transactions for the data source provided to it. The txAdvice
   uses this transaction manager and the attributes specify to
   create a transaction for all methods. Finally we need to
   apply this advice with an AOP pointcut.

<aop:config>
    <aop:pointcut id="daoMethods"
        expression="execution(* code.Ex3Dao.*(..))"/>
     <aop:advisor advice-ref="txAdvice" pointcut-ref="daoMethods"/>
</aop:config>


   This basically says that all methods called on the Ex3Dao
   interface will be wrapped in a transaction. To make use of
   this, we only have to retrieve the dao from the application
   context and call a method on the dao instance.
Ex3Dao dao = (Ex3Dao) ctx.getBean("dao");
Integer id = dao.createCity(name,  countryCode, district, pop);

   We can verify from this that there is no transaction
   management happening in our Java code and it is all
   configured with Spring. This is a very powerful notion and
   regarded as one of the most beneficial features of Spring.

13.3 Connection Pooling with Spring

   In many situations, such as web applications, there will be a
   large number of small database transactions. When this is the
   case, it usually makes sense to create a pool of database
   connections available for web requests as needed. Although
   MySQL does not spawn an extra process when a connection is
   made, there is still a small amount of overhead to create and
   set up the connection. Pooling of connections also alleviates
   problems such as collecting large amounts of sockets in the
   TIME_WAIT state.

   Setting up pooling of MySQL connections with Spring is as
   simple as changing the data source configuration in the
   application context. There are a number of configurations
   that we can use. The first example is based on the Jakarta
   Commons DBCP library
   (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/). The example below
   replaces the source configuration that was based on
   DriverManagerDataSource with DBCP's BasicDataSource.

<bean id="dataSource" destroy-method="close"
  class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource">
    <property name="driverClassName" value="${db.driver}"/>
    <property name="url" value="${db.jdbcurl}"/>
    <property name="username" value="${db.username}"/>
    <property name="password" value="${db.password}"/>
    <property name="initialSize" value="3"/>
</bean>


   The configuration of the two solutions is very similar. The
   difference is that DBCP will pool connections to the database
   instead of creating a new connection every time one is
   requested. We have also set a parameter here called
   initialSize. This tells DBCP that we want three connections
   in the pool when it is created.

   Another way to configure connection pooling is to configure a
   data source in our J2EE application server. Using JBoss as an
   example, you can set up the MySQL connection pool by creating
   a file called mysql-local-ds.xml and placing it in the
   server/default/deploy directory in JBoss. Once we have this
   setup, we can use JNDI to look it up. With Spring, this
   lookup is very simple. The data source configuration looks
   like this.

Chapter 14 Troubleshooting Connector/J Applications

   This section explains the symptoms and resolutions for the
   most commonly encountered issues with applications using
   MySQL Connector/J.

   Questions

     * 14.1: When I try to connect to the database with MySQL
       Connector/J, I get the following exception:
SQLException: Server configuration denies access to data source

       Driver'. Why is this happening?

     * 14.3: I'm trying to use MySQL Connector/J in an applet or
       application and I get an exception similar to:
SQLException: Cannot connect to MySQL server on host:3306.
Is there a MySQL server running on the machine/port you
are trying to connect to?

(java.security.AccessControlException)
SQLState: 08S01
VendorError: 0


     * 14.4: I have a servlet/application that works fine for a
       day, and then stops working overnight

     * 14.5: I cannot connect to the MySQL server using
       Connector/J, and I'm sure the connection parameters are
       correct.

     * 14.6: My application is deployed through JBoss and I am
       using transactions to handle the statements on the MySQL
       database. Under heavy loads, I am getting an error and
       stack trace, but these only occur after a fixed period of
       heavy activity.

     * 14.7: Updating a table that contains a primary key
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glo
       s_primary_key) that is either FLOAT
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/floating-point-ty
       pes.html) or compound primary key that uses FLOAT
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/floating-point-ty
       pes.html) fails to update the table and raises an
       exception.

     * 14.8: I get an ER_NET_PACKET_TOO_LARGE
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/error-messages-se
       rver.html#error_er_net_packet_too_large) exception, even
       though the binary blob size I want to insert using JDBC
       is safely below the max_allowed_packet
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-var

       similar to the following: "Communications link failure -
       Last packet sent to the server was X ms ago"?

     * 14.10: Why does Connector/J not reconnect to MySQL and
       re-issue the statement after a communication failure
       instead of throwing an Exception, even though I use the
       autoReconnect connection string option?

     * 14.11: How can I use 3-byte UTF8 with Connector/J?

     * 14.12: How can I use 4-byte UTF8, utf8mb4 with
       Connector/J?

     * 14.13: Using useServerPrepStmts=false and certain
       character encodings can lead to corruption when inserting
       BLOBs. How can this be avoided?

   Questions and Answers

   14.1: When I try to connect to the database with MySQL
   Connector/J, I get the following exception:
SQLException: Server configuration denies access to data source
SQLState: 08001
VendorError: 0

   What is going on? I can connect just fine with the MySQL
   command-line client.

   MySQL Connector/J must use TCP/IP sockets to connect to
   MySQL, as Java does not support Unix Domain Sockets.
   Therefore, when MySQL Connector/J connects to MySQL, the
   security manager in MySQL server will use its grant tables to
   determine whether the connection is permitted.

   You must add the necessary security credentials to the MySQL
   server for this to happen, using the GRANT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/grant.html) statement
   to your MySQL Server. See GRANT Syntax
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/grant.html), for more
   information.
   Note

   Testing your connectivity with the mysql command-line client
   will not work unless you add the "host" flag, and use
   something other than localhost for the host. The mysql
   command-line client will use Unix domain sockets if you use
   the special host name localhost. If you are testing
   connectivity to localhost, use 127.0.0.1 as the host name
   instead.
   Warning

   Changing privileges and permissions improperly in MySQL can
   potentially cause your server installation to not have
   optimal security properties.

   14.2: My application throws an SQLException 'No Suitable
   Driver'. Why is this happening?

   There are three possible causes for this error:

     * The Connector/J driver is not in your CLASSPATH, see
       Chapter 4, "Connector/J Installation."

     * The format of your connection URL is incorrect, or you
       are referencing the wrong JDBC driver.

     * When using DriverManager, the jdbc.drivers system
       property has not been populated with the location of the
       Connector/J driver.

   14.3: I'm trying to use MySQL Connector/J in an applet or
   application and I get an exception similar to:
SQLException: Cannot connect to MySQL server on host:3306.
Is there a MySQL server running on the machine/port you
are trying to connect to?

(java.security.AccessControlException)
SQLState: 08S01
VendorError: 0

   Either you're running an Applet, your MySQL server has been
   installed with the "skip-networking" option set, or your
   MySQL server has a firewall sitting in front of it.

   Applets can only make network connections back to the machine
   that runs the web server that served the .class files for the
   applet. This means that MySQL must run on the same machine
   (or you must have some sort of port re-direction) for this to
   work. This also means that you will not be able to test
   applets from your local file system, you must always deploy
   them to a web server.

   MySQL Connector/J can only communicate with MySQL using
   TCP/IP, as Java does not support Unix domain sockets. TCP/IP
   communication with MySQL might be affected if MySQL was
   started with the "skip-networking" flag, or if it is
   firewalled.

   If MySQL has been started with the "skip-networking" option
   set (the Debian Linux package of MySQL server does this for
   example), you need to comment it out in the file
   /etc/mysql/my.cnf or /etc/my.cnf. Of course your my.cnf file
   might also exist in the data directory of your MySQL server,
   or anywhere else (depending on how MySQL was compiled for
   your system). Binaries created by us always look in
   /etc/my.cnf and datadir/my.cnf. If your MySQL server has been
   firewalled, you will need to have the firewall configured to
   allow TCP/IP connections from the host where your Java code
   is running to the MySQL server on the port that MySQL is
   listening to (by default, 3306).

   14.4: I have a servlet/application that works fine for a day,
   and then stops working overnight

   MySQL closes connections after 8 hours of inactivity. You
   either need to use a connection pool that handles stale
   connections or use the autoReconnect parameter (see Section
   6.1, "Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL Syntax and
   Configuration Properties for Connector/J").

   Also, catch SQLExceptions in your application and deal with
   them, rather than propagating them all the way until your
   application exits. This is just good programming practice.
   MySQL Connector/J will set the SQLState (see
   java.sql.SQLException.getSQLState() in your API docs) to
   08S01 when it encounters network-connectivity issues during
   the processing of a query. Attempt to reconnect to MySQL at
   this point.

   The following (simplistic) example shows what code that can
   handle these exceptions might look like:

   Example 14.1 Connector/J: Example of transaction with retry
   logic
public void doBusinessOp() throws SQLException {
    Connection conn = null;
    Statement stmt = null;
    ResultSet rs = null;

    //
    // How many times do you want to retry the transaction
    // (or at least _getting_ a connection)?
    //
    int retryCount = 5;

    boolean transactionCompleted = false;

    do {
        try {
            conn = getConnection(); // assume getting this from a
                                    // javax.sql.DataSource, or the
                                    // java.sql.DriverManager

            conn.setAutoCommit(false);

            //

   Note

   Use of the autoReconnect option is not recommended because
   there is no safe method of reconnecting to the MySQL server
   without risking some corruption of the connection state or
   database state information. Instead, use a connection pool,
   which will enable your application to connect to the MySQL
   server using an available connection from the pool. The
   autoReconnect facility is deprecated, and may be removed in a
   future release.

   14.5: I cannot connect to the MySQL server using Connector/J,
   and I'm sure the connection parameters are correct.

   Make sure that the skip-networking
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-options.html#o
   ption_mysqld_skip-networking) option has not been enabled on
   your server. Connector/J must be able to communicate with
   your server over TCP/IP; named sockets are not supported.
   Also ensure that you are not filtering connections through a
   firewall or other network security system. For more
   information, see Can't connect to [local] MySQL server
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/can-not-connect-to-se
   rver.html).

   14.6: My application is deployed through JBoss and I am using
   transactions to handle the statements on the MySQL database.
   Under heavy loads, I am getting an error and stack trace, but
   these only occur after a fixed period of heavy activity.

   This is a JBoss, not Connector/J, issue and is connected to
   the use of transactions. Under heavy loads the time taken for
   transactions to complete can increase, and the error is
   caused because you have exceeded the predefined timeout.

   You can increase the timeout value by setting the
   TransactionTimeout attribute to the TransactionManagerService
   within the /conf/jboss-service.xml file (pre-4.0.3) or
   /deploy/jta-service.xml for JBoss 4.0.3 or later. See
   TransactionTimeout
   (http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=TransactionTimeout)
   within the JBoss wiki for more information.

   14.7: Updating a table that contains a primary key
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_pr
   imary_key) that is either FLOAT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/floating-point-types.
   html) or compound primary key that uses FLOAT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/floating-point-types.
   html) fails to update the table and raises an exception.

   Connector/J adds conditions to the WHERE clause during an
   UPDATE (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html)
   to check the old values of the primary key. If there is no
   match, then Connector/J considers this a failure condition
   and raises an exception.

   The problem is that rounding differences between supplied
   values and the values stored in the database may mean that
   the values never match, and hence the update fails. The issue
   will affect all queries, not just those from Connector/J.

   To prevent this issue, use a primary key that does not use
   FLOAT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/floating-point-types.
   html). If you have to use a floating point column in your
   primary key, use DOUBLE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/floating-point-types.
   html) or DECIMAL
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fixed-point-types.htm
   l) types in place of FLOAT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/floating-point-types.
   html).

   14.8: I get an ER_NET_PACKET_TOO_LARGE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/error-messages-server
   .html#error_er_net_packet_too_large) exception, even though
   the binary blob size I want to insert using JDBC is safely
   below the max_allowed_packet
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variabl
   es.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) size.

   This is because the hexEscapeBlock() method in
   com.mysql.cj.jdbc.PreparedStatement.streamToBytes() may
   almost double the size of your data.

   14.9: What should I do if I receive error messages similar to
   the following: "Communications link failure - Last packet
   sent to the server was X ms ago"?

   Generally speaking, this error suggests that the network
   connection has been closed. There can be several root causes:

     * Firewalls or routers may clamp down on idle connections
       (the MySQL client/server protocol does not ping).

     * The MySQL Server may be closing idle connections that
       exceed the wait_timeout or interactive_timeout threshold.

   Although network connections can be volatile, the following
   can be helpful in avoiding problems:

     * Ensure connections are valid when used from the
       connection pool. Use a query that starts with /* ping */
       to execute a lightweight ping instead of full query.
       Note, the syntax of the ping needs to be exactly as
       specified here.

     * Minimize the duration a connection object is left idle
       while other application logic is executed.

     * Explicitly validate the connection before using it if the
       connection has been left idle for an extended period of
       time.

     * Ensure that wait_timeout and interactive_timeout are set
       sufficiently high.

     * Ensure that tcpKeepalive is enabled.

     * Ensure that any configurable firewall or router timeout
       settings allow for the maximum expected connection idle
       time.

   Note

   Do not expect to be able to reuse a connection without
   problems if it has being lying idle for a period. If a
   connection is to be reused after being idle for any length of
   time, ensure that you explicitly test it before reusing it.

   14.10: Why does Connector/J not reconnect to MySQL and
   re-issue the statement after a communication failure instead
   of throwing an Exception, even though I use the autoReconnect
   connection string option?

   There are several reasons for this. The first is
   transactional integrity. The MySQL Reference Manual states
   that "there is no safe method of reconnecting to the MySQL
   server without risking some corruption of the connection
   state or database state information". Consider the following
   series of statements for example:

conn.createStatement().execute(
  "UPDATE checking_account SET balance = balance - 1000.00 WHERE custo
mer='Smith'");
conn.createStatement().execute(
  "UPDATE savings_account SET balance = balance + 1000.00 WHERE custom
er='Smith'");
conn.commit();


   Consider the case where the connection to the server fails
   after the UPDATE to checking_account. If no exception is
   thrown, and the application never learns about the problem,
   it will continue executing. However, the server did not
   commit the first transaction in this case, so that will get
   rolled back. But execution continues with the next
   transaction, and increases the savings_account balance by
   1000. The application did not receive an exception, so it
   continued regardless, eventually committing the second
   transaction, as the commit only applies to the changes made
   in the new connection. Rather than a transfer taking place, a
   deposit was made in this example.

   Note that running with autocommit enabled does not solve this
   problem. When Connector/J encounters a communication problem,
   there is no means to determine whether the server processed
   the currently executing statement or not. The following
   theoretical states are equally possible:

     * The server never received the statement, and therefore no
       related processing occurred on the server.

     * The server received the statement, executed it in full,
       but the response was not received by the client.

   If you are running with autocommit enabled, it is not
   possible to guarantee the state of data on the server when a
   communication exception is encountered. The statement may
   have reached the server, or it may not. All you know is that
   communication failed at some point, before the client
   received confirmation (or data) from the server. This does
   not only affect autocommit statements though. If the
   communication problem occurred during Connection.commit(),
   the question arises of whether the transaction was committed
   on the server before the communication failed, or whether the
   server received the commit request at all.

   The second reason for the generation of exceptions is that
   transaction-scoped contextual data may be vulnerable, for
   example:

     * Temporary tables.

     * User-defined variables.

     * Server-side prepared statements.

   These items are lost when a connection fails, and if the
   connection silently reconnects without generating an
   exception, this could be detrimental to the correct execution
   of your application.

   In summary, communication errors generate conditions that may
   well be unsafe for Connector/J to simply ignore by silently
   reconnecting. It is necessary for the application to be
   notified. It is then for the application developer to decide
   how to proceed in the event of connection errors and
   failures.

   14.11: How can I use 3-byte UTF8 with Connector/J?

   To use 3-byte UTF8 with Connector/J set
   characterEncoding=utf8 and set useUnicode=true in the
   connection string.

   14.12: How can I use 4-byte UTF8, utf8mb4 with Connector/J?

   To use 4-byte UTF8 with Connector/J configure the MySQL
   server with character_set_server=utf8mb4. Connector/J will
   then use that setting as long as characterEncoding has not
   been set in the connection string. This is equivalent to
   autodetection of the character set.

   14.13: Using useServerPrepStmts=false and certain character
   encodings can lead to corruption when inserting BLOBs. How
   can this be avoided?

   When using certain character encodings, such as SJIS, CP932,
   and BIG5, it is possible that BLOB data contains characters
   that can be interpreted as control characters, for example,
   backslash, '\'. This can lead to corrupted data when
   inserting BLOBs into the database. There are two things that
   need to be done to avoid this:

    1. Set the connection string option useServerPrepStmts to
       true.

    2. Set SQL_MODE to NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES.

15.2 How to Report Connector/J Bugs or Problems

   The normal place to report bugs is http://bugs.mysql.com/,
   which is the address for our bugs database. This database is
   public, and can be browsed and searched by anyone. If you log
   in to the system, you will also be able to enter new reports.

   If you find a sensitive security bug in MySQL Server, please
   let us know immediately by sending an email message to
   secalert_us@oracle.com. Exception: Support customers should
   report all problems, including security bugs, to Oracle
   Support at http://support.oracle.com/.

   Writing a good bug report takes patience, but doing it right
   the first time saves time both for us and for yourself. A
   good bug report, containing a full test case for the bug,
   makes it very likely that we will fix the bug in the next
   release.

   This section will help you write your report correctly so
   that you do not waste your time doing things that may not
   help us much or at all.

   If you have a repeatable bug report, please report it to the
   bugs database at http://bugs.mysql.com/. Any bug that we are
   able to repeat has a high chance of being fixed in the next
   MySQL release.

   To report other problems, you can use one of the MySQL
   mailing lists.

   Remember that it is possible for us to respond to a message
   containing too much information, but not to one containing
   too little. People often omit facts because they think they
   know the cause of a problem and assume that some details do
   not matter.

   A good principle is this: If you are in doubt about stating
   something, state it. It is faster and less troublesome to
   write a couple more lines in your report than to wait longer
   for the answer if we must ask you to provide information that
   was missing from the initial report.

   The most common errors made in bug reports are (a) not
   including the version number of Connector/J or MySQL used,
   and (b) not fully describing the platform on which
   Connector/J is installed (including the JVM version, and the
   platform type and version number that MySQL itself is
   installed on).

   This is highly relevant information, and in 99 cases out of
   100, the bug report is useless without it. Very often we get
   questions like, "Why doesn't this work for me?" Then we find
   that the feature requested was not implemented in that MySQL
   version, or that a bug described in a report has already been
   fixed in newer MySQL versions.

   Sometimes the error is platform-dependent; in such cases, it
   is next to impossible for us to fix anything without knowing
   the operating system and the version number of the platform.

   If at all possible, create a repeatable, standalone testcase
   that doesn't involve any third-party classes.

   To streamline this process, we ship a base class for
   testcases with Connector/J, named
   'com.mysql.cj.jdbc.util.BaseBugReport'. To create a testcase
   for Connector/J using this class, create your own class that
   inherits from com.mysql.cj.jdbc.util.BaseBugReport and
   override the methods setUp(), tearDown() and runTest().

   In the setUp() method, create code that creates your tables,
   and populates them with any data needed to demonstrate the
   bug.

   In the runTest() method, create code that demonstrates the
   bug using the tables and data you created in the setUp
   method.

   In the tearDown() method, drop any tables you created in the
   setUp() method.

   In any of the above three methods, use one of the variants of
   the getConnection() method to create a JDBC connection to
   MySQL:

     * getConnection() - Provides a connection to the JDBC URL
       specified in getUrl(). If a connection already exists,
       that connection is returned, otherwise a new connection
       is created.

     * getNewConnection() - Use this if you need to get a new
       connection for your bug report (that is, there is more
       than one connection involved).

     * getConnection(String url) - Returns a connection using
       the given URL.

     * getConnection(String url, Properties props) - Returns a
       connection using the given URL and properties.

   If you need to use a JDBC URL that is different from
   'jdbc:mysql:///test', override the method getUrl() as well.

   Use the assertTrue(boolean expression) and assertTrue(String
   failureMessage, boolean expression) methods to create
   conditions that must be met in your testcase demonstrating
   the behavior you are expecting (vs. the behavior you are
   observing, which is why you are most likely filing a bug
   report).

   Finally, create a main() method that creates a new instance
   of your testcase, and calls the run method:
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
      new MyBugReport().run();
 }

   Once you have finished your testcase, and have verified that
   it demonstrates the bug you are reporting, upload it with
   your bug report to http://bugs.mysql.com/.
